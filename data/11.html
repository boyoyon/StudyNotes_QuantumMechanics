        <h1><center>XI RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF THE ELECTRON<br>電子の相対論的理論</center></h1>
<h2>66. Relativistic treatment of a particle</h2>
<p>
Tus theory we have been building up so far is essentially a non-
relativistic one. We have been working all the time with one par-
ticular Lorentz frame of reference and have set up the theory as an
analogue of the classical non-relativistic dynamics. Let us now try
to make the theory invariant under Lorentz transformations, so that
it conforms to the special principle of relativity. This is necessary in
order that the theory may apply to high-speed particles. There is no
need to make the theory conform to general relativity, since general
relativity is required only when one is dealing with gravitation, and
gravitational forces are quite unimportant in atomic phenomena.

Let us see how the basic ideas of quantum theory can be adapted
to the relativistic point of view that the four dimensions of space-
time should be treated on the same footing. The general principle
of superposition of states, as given in Chapter [, is a relativistic
principle, since it applies to ‘states’ with the relativistic space-time
meaning. However, the general concept of an observable does not fit
in, since an observable may involve physical things at widely separated
points at one instant of time. In consequence, if one works with a
general representation referring to any complete set of commuting
observables, the theory cannot display the symmetry between space
and time required by relativity. In relativistic quantum mechanics
one must be content with having one representation which displays
this symmetry. One then has the freedom to transform to another
representation referring to a special Lorentz frame of reference if it
is useful for a particular calculation. ,

For the problem of a single particle, in order to display the sym-
metry between space and time we must use the Schrodinger repre-
sentation. Let us put 21, 2%, 2; for x, y, 2, and x for ct. The time-
dependent wave function then appears as (7,2, 2,23) and provides
us with a basis for treating the four x’s on the same footing.

We shall use relativistic notation, writing the four 2’s as x,
(u = 0, 1, 2,3). Any space-time vector with four components which
transform under Lorentz transformations like the four elements dz,,

will be written like a, with a lower Greek suffix. We may raise the
﻿254 RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF THE ELECTRON § 66

suffix according to the rules
a = G, a = —d, a = —a,, a = —as. (1)

The a,, are called the contravariant components of the vector a, and
the a# the covariant components. Two vectors a, and 6, have a

Lorentz-invariant sealar product

Ag by — Ay by — Gy by — ig bg = ab, = G4, bY,
a summation being implied over a repeated letter suffix. The funda-
mental tensor g#” is defined by

g® = 1 git = g? = g3 = —]
gg’? = 0 forp -v.
With its help the rules (1) connecting covariant and contravariant
components may be written
Qe = gta,

In the Schrédinger representation the momentum, whose com-
ponents will now be written p,, pp, ps instead of p,, Py, Pz, 18 equal
to the operator

p, = —haléx, (r= 1, 2, 8). (3)

Now the four operators 6/éx,, form the covariant components of a
4-vector whose contravariant components are written @/éx#. So to
bring (3) into a relativistic theory, we must first write it with its

suffixes balanced, p, = th alex’,

and then extend it to the complete 4-vector equation
Dy, = th 8/800". (4)
We thus have to introduce a new dynamical variable p,, equal to
the operator 7% 6/éay. Since it forms a 4-vector when combined with the
momenta p,, it must have the physical meaning of the energy of the
particle divided by c. We can proceed to develop the theory treating
the four p’s on the same footing, like the four x’s. ,
In the theory of the electron that will be developed here we shall
have to introduce a further degree of freedom describing an internal
motion of the electron. The wave function will thus have to involve
a further variable besides the four z’s.

67. The wave equation for the electron

Let us consider first the case of the motion of an electron in the
absence of an electromagnetic field, so that the problem is simply
﻿§ 67 THE WAVE EQUATION FOR THE ELECTRON 255

that of the free particle, as dealt with in § 30, with the possible
addition, of internal degrees of freedom. The relativistic Hamiltonian
provided by classical mechanics for this system is given by equation
(23) of § 30, and leads to the wave equation

{po (mc? + pit p3+-p3)}p = 0, (5)
‘where the p’s are interpreted as operators in accordance with
(4). Equation (5), although it takes into account the relation between
energy and momentum required by relativity, is yet unsatisfactory
from the point of view of relativistic theory, because it is very un-
symmetrical between p, and the other p’s, so much so that one cannot
generalize it in a relativistic way to the case when there is a field
present. We must therefore look for a new wave equation.
If we multiply the wave equation (5) on the left by the operator
{pot (m?c?+ pi+ p2+p3)!}, we obtain the equation

{pj— me? — pi—pi— PP = 9, (6)
which is of a relativistically invariant form and may therefore more
conveniently be taken as the basis of a relativistic theory. Equation
(6) is not completely equivalent to equation (5) since, although every
solution of (5) is also a solution of (6), the converse is not true. Only
those solutions of (6) belonging to positive values for p, are also
solutions of (5).

The wave equation (6) is not of the form required by the general
laws of the quantum theory on account of its being quadratic in pp.
In § 27 we deduced from quite general arguments that the wave
equation must be linear in the operator 6/ét or po, like equation (7)
of that section. We therefore seek a wave equation that is linear
in p, and that is roughly equivalent to (6). In order that this wave
equation shall transform in a simple way under a Lorentz transforma-
tion, we try to arrange that it shall be rational and linear in p,, po,
and p, as well as in py, and thus-of the form

{Po— 1 Pi 2 P2— %3 Pg— BJ = O, (7)
where the «’s and 8 are independent of the p’s. Since we are consider-
ing the case of no field, all points in space-time must be equivalent,
so that the operator in the wave equation must not involve the z’s.
Thus the «’s and B must also be independent of the x’s, so that they
must commute with the p’s and the z’s. They therefore describe
some new degree of freedom, belonging to some internal motion in
﻿256 RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF THE ELECTRON § 67

the electron. We shall see later that they bring in the spin of the
electron.
Multiplying (7) by the operator {py-+ a, p1+o2Po+%3 P3+f} on the
left, we obtain
(Bi 3 lod t+ (or ao-+on a) Pr Pa + (a B+Boy)p] Bly = 0,

where > refers to cyclic permutations of the suffixes 1,2, 3. This is
123

the same as (6) if the «’s and f satisfy the relations

of = 1, Oly Ny + Oy oy == 0,
B= mec? B+ Ba, = 0,
together with the relations obtained from these by permuting the
suffixes 1, 2, 3. If we write
B = a, Me,
these relations may be summed up in the single one,
gq Ap toy Xy = 26,, (a,b = 1, 2, 3, orm). (8)

The four «’s all anticommute with one another and the square of
each is unity.

Thus by giving suitable properties to the a’s and 8 we can make
the wave equation (7) equivalent to (6), in so far as the motion of
the electron as a whole is concerned. We may now assume (7) is the
correct relativistic wave equation for the motion of an electron in
the absence of a field. This gives rise to one difficulty, however,
owing to the fact that (7), like (6), is not exactly equivalent to (5),
but allows solutions corresponding to negative as well as positive
values of p). The former do not, of course, correspond to any actually
observable motion of an electron. For the present we shall consider
only the positive-energy solutions and shall leave the discussion of
the negative-energy ones to § 73.

We can easily obtain a representation of the four a’s. They have
similar algebraic properties to the o’s introduced in § 37, which o’s
can be represented by matrices with two rows and columns. So long
as we keep to matrices with two rows and columns we cannot get a
representation of more than three anticommuting quantities, and we
have to go to four rows and columns to get a representation of the
four anticommuting a’s. It is convenient first to express the a’s in
terms of the o’s and also of a second similar set of three anticom-

muting variables whose squares are unity, p;, po, pg Say, that are
﻿§ 67 THE WAVE EQUATION FOR THE ELECTRON 257

independent of and commute with the o’s. We may take, amongst
other possibilities,

Oy == PL Fis Og —= Pi Fas 3 —= P1583, Om = Par (9)
and the «’s will then satisfy all the relations (8), as may easily be

verified. If we now take a representation with p, and o, diagonal,
we shall get the following scheme of matrices:

= /0 1 0 0\ = /0O-i 0 0\ o=/l 0 0 0
10 0 a0 0 0 0-1 0 0
00 01 0 0 0-1 0 0 1 0
0 0 1 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 O-!1

p= /0 0 1 0\ pp= /0 0-%.0\ pp=/l1 0 0 0
000 1 0 0 0-1 0 1 06 #0
10 0 0 +0 0 0 0 O-—1 0
0 1 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 0 O-T/.

It should be noted that the p’s and o’s are all Hermitian, which makes

the «’s also Hermitian.

Corresponding to the four rows and columns, the wave function 4
must contain a variable that takes on four values, in order that the
matrices shall be capable of being multiplied into it. Alternatively,
we may look upon the wave function as having four components, each
a function only of the four x’s. We saw in § 37 that the spin of the
electron requires the wave function to have two components. The
fact that our present theory gives four is due to our wave equation
(7) having twice as many solutions as it ought to have, half of them
corresponding to states of negative energy.

With the help of (9), the wave equation (7) may be written with
three-dimensional vector notation

{Po— pr(3, P)—pamepp = 0. (10)
To generalize this equation to the case when there is an electro-
magnetic field present, we follow the classical rule of replacing p, and
p by pte/c.A, and p+e/c.A, Ay and A being the scalar and vector
potentials of the field at the place where the electron is. This gives
us the equation

{p,+£4.—o,(o. p+5A)—pomel = 0, (11)

which is the fundamental wave equation of the relativistic theory of
the electron.
﻿258 RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF THE ELECTRON § 67

The four components of ¢ in (10) or (11) should be pictured as written
one below another, so as to form a single-column matrix. The square
matrices p and o then get multiplied into the single-column matrix
according to matrix multiplication, the product being in each case
another single-column matrix. The conjugate imaginary wave func-
tion that represents a bra should be pictured as having its four com-
ponents written one beside another, so as to form a single-row matrix,
which can be multiplied from the right by a square matrix p or a to give
another single-row matrix. We denote this conjugate imaginary wave
function pictured as a single-row matrix by J‘, using the symbol * to
denote the transpose of any matrix, i.e. the result of interchanging
the rows and columns, Then the conjugate imaginary of equation (11)

reads ve e e
B [pote do—n(eP+2A)—pame]|=0, 02)

in which the operators p operate to the left. An operator of differentia-
tion operating to the left must be interpreted according to (24) of § 22.

68. Invariance under a Lorentz transformation

Before proceeding to discuss the physical consequences of the wave
equation (11) or (12), we shall first verify that our theory really is
invariant under a Lorentz transformation, or, stated more accurately,
that the physical results the theory leads to are independent of the
Lorentz frame of reference used. This is not by any means obvious
from the form of the wave equation (11). We have to verify that, if
we write down the wave equation in a different Lorentz frame, the
solutions of the new wave equation may be put into one-one corre-
spondence with those of the original one in such a way that corre-
sponding solutions may be assumed to represent the same state. For
either Lorentz frame, the square of the modulus of the wave function,
summed over the four components, should give the probability per
unit volume of the electron being at a certain place in that Lorentz
frame. We may call this the probability density. Its values, calculated
in different Lorentz frames for wave functions representing the same
state, should be connected like the time components in these frames

.of some 4-vector. Further, the 4-dimensional divergence of this 4-

vector should vanish, signifying conservation of the electron, or that
the electron cannot appear or disappear in any volume without passing

through the boundary.
﻿§68 INVARIANCE UNDER A LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION 259

For brevity it is convenient to introduce the symbol a) = 1 and to

suppose that the suffixes of the four a, (4 = 0, 1, 2, 3) can be raised
in accordance with the rules (1), even though these four «’s do not

form the components of a 4-vector. We can now write the wave
equation (11) {ou"(p,-+e/e.A,)—a, mo} = 9. (13)
The four « satisfy

oor, 0 are, a == Qgh a, (14)
with g«” defined by (2), as one can verify by taking separately the cases
when p and v are both 0, when one of them is 0, and when neither of

them is 0.
Let us apply an infinitesimal Lorentz transformation and distinguish

quantities referring to the new frame of reference by a star. The com-
ponents of the 4-vector p, will transform according to equations of

th
e type pe = py +a,"D,, (15)

where the a,” are small numbers of the first order. We shall neglect
quantities that are quadratic in the a’s and thus of the second order.
The condition for a Lorentz transformation is that :

DL pe* = p, ph,
which gives a,"p, pe+p,, ap, = 0,
leading to ghee Lage == 0. (16)

The components of A,, will transform according to the same law, so
we have

Pytele.A, = pte. Ai—a,"(pyt efe. A*),
Thus the wave equation (13) becomes
((at—ahayt)( pis 6/0 Af) — cy, me}h = 0. (17)
Define M = ha, ofa, a7. (18)
Then from (14)

CO gy ME — Mi csp, ot = FU yey (LM Oly, AP + OP Og OH) Oty, CE —

po

BA pg (GhPou? — chy?)

I

—4 oP
with the help of (16), and hence
oH (1 +-om M) = (1+ Mery) (oi —a,F0). (19)
Thus, multiplying (17) by (1+ M«,,) on the left, we get
{oe(1 tot, M) (pi + e/c. A) — (om -+ Mme} = 0.
﻿260 RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF THE ELECTRON § 68
So if we put +o, Mb = o*, (20)
we get {a(pi-te/c. AZ) —o,, mepp* = 0. (21)

- This is of the same form as (13) with the starred variables pi, AZ, $*,
and shows that (13) is invariant under an infinitesimal Lorentz trans-
formation, provided % is subjected to the right transformation, given
by (20). A finite Lorentz transformation can be built up from infinite-
simal ones, so under a finite Lorentz transformation the wave equation
(13)is also invariant. Note that the matrices «+ do not get altered at all.

The invariance proved above means that the solutions } of the
original wave equation (13) are in one-one correspondence with the
solutions %* of the new wave equation (21), corresponding solutions
being connected by (20). We assume that corresponding solutions
represent the same physical state. We must now verify that the
physical interpretations of corresponding solutions, referred to their
respective Lorentz frames of reference, are in agreement. This requires
that J's should give the probability density referred to the original
frame and J*'%* the probability density referred to the new frame.
Let us examine the relationship between these quantities. pty is the
same as ys'a% and forms one of the four quantities Jfas, which should
be treated together.

Equations (18) and (16) show that M is pure imaginary. Thus the
conjugate imaginary of equation (20) is

prt oe = pl Mee)
PRang* = FL —Moy, ot poy Mp
= £t(1—Ma,,)(1+ Ma,,)(o*—a,to” yb
from (19). This reduces to
Dean = Pata, yb
= Porpam, plary
with the help of (16}. If we lower the suffix u here, we get an equation
of the same form as (15), which shows that the four quantities J'c,, y
transform like the contravariant components of a 4-vector. Thus pty
transforms like the time component of a 4-vector, which is the correct
transformation law for a probability density. The space components
of the 4-vector, namely ¢*u, 1, if multiplied by c, give the probability

current, or the probability of the electron crossing unit area per
unit time.

Hence

It should be noted that #*a,,) is invariant, since

We must verify finally the conservation law, that the divergence

The result is

which just expresses the vanishing of (22). In this way we complete
the proof that our theory gives consistent results in whichever frame

of reference it is applied.

69. The motion of a free electron

It is of interest to consider the motion of a free electron in the
Heisenberg picture according to the above theory and to study the
Heisenberg equations of motion. These equations of motion can be
integrated exactly, as was first done by Schrédinger.{ For brevity
we shall omit the suffix ¢ which the notation of § 28 requires to be
inserted in dynamical variables that vary with time in the Heisen-

berg picture. ,
As Hamiltonian we must take the expression which we get as equal

to cp) when we put the operator on in (10) equal to zero, ie.
H = cp,(o, p)+pymec? = c(a, p)+pgme’. (23)

We see at once that the momentum commutes with H and is thus a
constant of the motion. Further, the z,-component of the velocity is

dy = [2,,H] = cay. (24)

This result is rather surprising, as it means an altogether different

t Schrédinger, Sitzungsd. d. Berlin. Akad., 1930, p. 418.

3595.57 iS)
﻿262 RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF THE ELECTRON § 69

relation between velocity and momentum from what one has in
classical mechanics. It is connected, however, with the expression
bea, for a component of the probability current. The #, given by (24)
has as eigenvalues --c, corresponding to the eigenvalues -+-1 of o,.
As % and @, are similar, we can conclude that a measurement of a com-
ponent of the velocity of a free electron is certain to lead to the result -ke.
This conclusion is easily seen to hold also when there is a field present.

Since electrons are observed in practice to have velocities con-
siderably less than that of light, it would seem that we have here a
contradiction with experiment. The contradiction is not real, though,
since the theoretical velocity in the above conclusion is the velocity
at one instant of time while observed velocities are always average
velocities through appreciable time intervals. We shall find upon
further examination of the equations of motion that the velocity is
not at all constant, but oscillates rapidly about a mean value which
agrees with the observed value.

It may easily be verified that a measurement of a component of the
velocity must lead to the result +-c in a relativistic theory, simply
from an elementary application of the principle of uncertainty of
§ 24. To measure the velocity we must measure the position at two
slightly different times and then divide the change of position by the
time interval. (It will not do to measure the momentum and apply
a formula, as the ordinary connexion between velocity and momen-
tum is not valid.) In order that our measured velocity may approxi-
mate to the instantaneous velocity, the time interval between the
two measurements of position must be very short and hence these
measurements must be very accurate. The great accuracy with
which the position of the electron is known during the time-interval
must give rise, according to the principle of uncertainty, to an almost
complete indeterminacy in its momentum. This means that almost
all values of the momentum are equally probable, so that the momen-
tum is almost certain to be infinite. An infinite value for a component
of momentum corresponds to the value +c for the corresponding
component of velocity.

Let us now examine how the velocity of the electron varies with
time. We have tidy <= oy H— Hon.

Now since «, anticommutes with all the terms in H except ca, D,,

0 AE Hoy = on Coy Py + Coy Py oy = 2H,
﻿§ 69 THE MOTION OF A FREE ELECTRON 263

and hence

they = 2a, 1—2cp,, (25)

= —2Ho,+2cp,.
Since H and , are constants, it follows from the first of equations
(25) that ihe, = Qe H. (26)

This differential equation in &, can be integrated immediately, the
result being (27)

where a? is a constant, equal to the value of &, when ¢= 0. The
factor e~2/#"% must be put to the right of the factor a? in (27) on
account of the H occurring to the right of the &, in (26). The second
of equations (25) leads in the same way to the result

dy == ORIG D,

eee BO p—Bi Hh
ay = aye’ tr

We can now easily complete the integration of the equation of motion
for x,. From (27) and the first of equations (25)

oy = fthad eA on, HO, (28)
and hence the time-integral of equation (24) is
By = —FchPal eR 2p, Ht-+ay, (29)

a, being a constant.

From (28) we see that the xz, component of velocity, ca,, consists
of two parts, a constant part c*p, 7-1, connected with the momentum
by the classical relativistic formula, and an oscillatory part

Mohad e—2HinFT-1,
whose frequency is high, being 2H/h, which is at least 2mc?/h. Only
the constant part would be observed in a practical measurement of
velocity, such a measurement giving the average velocity through a
time-interval much larger than h/2mc*. The oscillatory part secures

that the instantaneous value of ¢, shall have the eigenvalues +c. The
oscillatory part of x, is small, being, according to (29),

—fehiPad e~2Hit 2 = Mich(a,—cp, HY)H-,
which is of the order of magnitude fi/me, since (a,—cp, H-) is of the
order of magnitude unity.

70. Existence of the spin

In § 67 we saw that the correct wave equation for the electron in
the absence of an electromagnetic field, namely equation (7) or (10), is
equivalent to the wave equation (6) which is suggested from analogy
﻿264 RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF THE ELECTRON § 70

with the classical theory. This equivalence no longer holds when
there is a field. The wave equation to be expected from analogy with
the classical theory in this case is

€

(eo ! Ad) (P cA) mectlys = 0, (30)

in. which the operator is just the classical relativistic Hamiltonian. If
we multiply (11) by some factor on the left to make it resemble
(30) as closely as possible, namely the factor

Po +f Acto(e, Dp +54) 1 pg me,

we get

[Pet Ge) —[o.p+5A) —mtet—oi[ (ro +5 40](e.P-+54)—
—(2,p+2A}[ro+£40)]}o=0. (0

We now use the general formula that, if B and C are any two
three-dimensional vectors that commute with o,

(o, B)(o, C) = > {o? B,C +6, 0, B,Cy+o.0, By Ci},

or (¢, B)(o, C) = (B, C)-+4 3 o5(B, O,— B,C)

= (B,C)+i(6,BxC). (32)

Taking B = C == p-+e/c.A, we find, since
(p+) x (p+<a) = “{pXxA+Ax P}
== —thefe.curlA = —the/c.F,
where # is the magnetic field, that

2 2 iy
(e.p-+£a) =(p+£a) +2 00m, (33)

Also we have

(r4+£45}(2, p-+24)—(o, p-+2A](p,+244]

﻿§ 70 EXISTENCE OF THE SPIN 265

where & is the electric field. Thus (31) becomes

[(e. ! =A,) (e ! cA) mie —" (6, #)-+ip, (6, €)}p = 0.
(34)
This equation differs from (30) through having two extra terms in
the operator. These extra terms involve some new physical effects,
but since they are not real they do not lend themselves very directly
to physical interpretation.

To get an understanding of the physical features involved in the
difference between (34) and (30) it is better to work with the Heisen-
berg picture, this picture being always the more suitable one for
comparisons between classical and quantum mechanics. The Heisen-
berg equations of motion are determined by the Hamiltonian

H= —edy-+ep, (a, p-+EA) + pare! (35)

the generalization of (23) to the case when there is a field. Equation

(35) gives

H 2
(F+{4,] = lal. p+5A)-+pyme|

e 2

= (pea) mire Som) (36)

c

with the help of (33). We have here the real part of the extra terms
in (34) appearing without the pure imaginary part. For an electron
moving slowly (ie. with small momentum), we may expect the
Heisenberg equations of motion to be determined by a Hamiltonian
of the form mc?--H,, where H, is small compared with mc®. Putting
me+H, for H in (36) and neglecting H? and other terms involving
c~2, we get, on dividing by 2m,

1 e,\? fi
Hytedy = 5-(P+5A) +52(0¥) (37)

The Hamiltonian H, given by (37) is the same as the classical
Hamiltonian for a slow electron, except for the last term

he
Img en

This term may be considered as an additional potential energy
﻿266 RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF THE ELECTRON § 70

which a slow electron has in the quantum theory and may be
interpreted as arising from the electron having a magnetic moment
-—tie/2mc.e. This magnetic moment is the one assumed in §§ 41 and
47 for dealing with the Zeeman effect and is in agreement with
experiment.

The spin angular momentum does not give rise to any potential
energy and therefore does not appear in the result of the preceding
calculation. The simplest way of showing the existence of the spin
angular momentum is to take the case of the motion of a free electron
or an electron in a central field of force and determine the angular
momentum integrals, This means working with the Hamiltonian (23),
or with the Hamiltonian (35) with A = 0 and A, a function of the

radius 7, Le, Hf — —eAg(r) +ep,(6, p)-+pyme’, (38)
and obtaining the Heisenberg equations of motion for the angular
momentum. With either Hamiltonian we find for the rate of change

of the z,-component of orbital angular momentum, My = X_P3—X5 Po,
with the help of commutation relations proved in § 35,

im, = m,H—-Hm,
= ¢p,{m,(s, p)—(s, p)m}
= Cp,(,m, P— pm)
= thepy{o,p3— 3 Po}.
Thus mm, +4 0 and the orbital angular momentum is not a constant
of the motion. This result is to be expected from the integrated

equation of motion (29), the oscillatory part of the motion here dis-

played giving rise to an oscillatory term in the angular momentum.
We have further

tid, = 0, H—Ho,

= Cpx{o1(6, P)—(6, P)oj}

= Cp1(0,5—Goy, P)

= 2icpy{o3 P2—o Ps}
with the help of equations (51) of § 37. Hence

m,+4lid, = 0,

so that the vector m-+Jiio is a constant of the motion. This result
one can interpret by saying the electron has a spin angular momentum

she, which must be added to the orbital angular momentum m before
one gets a constant of the motion. The spin angular momentum
﻿§ 70 EXISTENCE OF THE SPIN - 267

could alternatively be obtained from the rotation operators for states
of spin in accordance with the general method of § 35.

The same vector o fixes the directions of both the spin magnetic
moment and the spin angular momentum. If an electron in a certain
state of spin has a spin angular momentum of 4/ in a particular
direction, it will have a magnetic moment —eh/2me in the same
direction.

We were led to the value 4/4 for the spin of the electron by an
argument depending simply on general principles of quantum theory
and relativity. One could apply the same argument to other kinds
of elementary particle and one would be led to the same conclusion,
that the spin angular momentum is half a quantum. This would be
satisfactory for the proton and the neutron, but there are some kinds
of elementary particle (e.g. the photon and certain kinds of meson)
whose spins are known experimentally to be different from 3%, so we
have a discrepancy between our theory and experiment.

The answer is to be found in a hidden assumption in our work.
Our argument is valid only provided the position of the particle is
an observable. If this assumption holds, the particle must have a
spin angular momentum of half a quantum. For those particles that
have a different spin the assumption must be false and any dynamical
variables z,, %,, t3 that may be introduced to describe the position
of the particle cannot be observables in accordance with our general
theory. For such particles there is no true Schrodinger representation.
One might be able to introduce a quasi wave function involving the
dynamical variables x, 22, %, but it would not have the correct
physical interpretation of a wave function——that the square of its
modulus gives the probability density. For such particles there is still
a momentum representation, which is sufficient for practical purposes.

71. Transition to polar variables

For the further study of the motion of an electron in a central field
of force with the Hamiltonian (38), it is convenient to make a
transformation to polar coordinates, as was done in § 38 in the
non-relativistic case. We can introduce r and p, as before, but
instead of k, the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum m,
which is no longer a constant of the motion, we must now use the
magnitude of the total angular momentum M = m+ 4c. Let us put

PW = ME} G+ MR Pe. (39)
﻿268 RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF THE ELECTRON § 71

The eigenvalues of m, are integral multiples of #, those of dio, are
+37, and hence those of M; must be half odd integral multiples of

i. It follows from the theory of § 36 that the eigenvalues of |j| must
be integers greater than zero.

If in formula (32) we take B = C = m, we get

(¢,m)? = m?+7(6,m xm)
= m?_fi(e, m)
= (m+ Mie)?—2h(e, m)—2h2.
Hence {(o,m)+A}? = M? ARP,

Thus (o,m)+4# is a quantity whose square is M?+ 4#? and we could,
consistently with equation (39), define jf as (6,m)-+-%. This would
not be the most convenient definition for j, however, since we would
like to have j a constant of the motion and (6, m)-+4 is not constant.
We have, in fact, from applications of (32),

(s,m)(o, p) = i{6,m > p)
and (o, p)(o,m) = i(¢, px m),
so that ,

(6,m)(s, p)+-(6, p)(o,m) =71> oy{My Ds Ms De 1 Py M3—Pz Mo}

123

= 14> o,. 2p, = — 26, p),

123
or {(s, m)+i}(o, p)+(, p){(e, m)-+A} = 0.
Thus («, m)-+-# anticommutes with one of the terms in the expression
(38) for H, namely the term cp,(s, p), and commutes with the other
two. It follows that p,{(¢, m)+#} commutes with all the three terms

in # and is a constant of the motion. But the square of pat(a, m)+h}
is also M*-+-472, We can therefore take

jh = ps{(a,m)-+Hi}, (40)
which gives us a convenient rational definition for 7 which is consis-
tent with (39) and makes j a constant of the motiori. The eigenvalues
of this j are all positive and negative integers, excluding zero.

By a further application of (32), we get

(6, x)(6, p) = (x, p)-+i(«, m)
= 1p,bip,ji—ilhi (41)
with the help of (40) and also of equation (58) of §38. We introduce
the linear operator « defined by

re = p,(a, X). (42)
﻿§ 71 TRANSITION TO POLAR VARIABLES 269

Since r conimutes with p, and with (sc, x), it must commute with e.
We thus have

2 = [p,(6, x) = (6x2? =P =P

d

or 2 == |,

Now p,(s, p) commutes with j, and since there is symmetry between
x and p so far as angular momentum is concerned, p,(a, x) must also
commute withj. Hence « commutes with 7. Further, e must commute
with p,, since we have

(5, X)(X, P)—(X, P)(o, X) = (6, X(x, p)—(X, p)x) = ih(, x),
which gives rerp,—rp,re == thre,
or rep,—r*p,e = 0.
From (41) and (42) we obtain

repy(@,D) = 1P,+ipajt—ih,

or px(6, P) = «(p,—th/r)+-tep,jh/r.
Thus (38) becomes

Hje = —efc.Ay+«(p,—th/r)+tep,jh/r+ ps me.

This gives our Hamiltonian expressed in terms of polar variables. It
should be noticed that « and p, commute with all the other variables
occurring in H and anticommute with one another. This means that
we can take a representation with p, diagonal in which e and pg are
represented respectively by the matrices

(oo) oa)

If r is also diagonal in the representation, the representative
<r'p3\> of a ket will have two components, <7’,1]> = #,(r’) and
<r’, —1]> = #,(r’) say, referring to the two rows and columns of the
matrices (43).

72. The fine-structure of the energy-levels of hydrogen

Weshall now take the case of the hydrogen atom, for which A, = e/r,
and work out its energy-levels, given by the eigenvalues H’ of H.
The equation (H’—#)|> == 0 which defines these eigenvalues, when
written in terms of representatives in the representation discussed

Put th, = roleraf, hy = rolentlag, (46)
introducing two new functions, f and g, of r, where

Equations (45) become

We now try for a solution in which f and g are in the form of power
series, f= Der, g == Ser, (49)
s §

in which consecutive values of s differ by unity though these values
need not be integers. Substituting these expressions for f and g in
(48) and picking out coefficients of rs-1, we obtain

(48)

C,4/My ACs (s ICs Co-1/@ = 0, (50)

Cy-1[Aq+al,— (S—~J)Cp+C,4/4 = 0.
By multiplying the first of these equations by a and the second by

a and subtracting, we eliminate both c,_, and c,_,, since from
(47) aja, = a,/a. We are left with

[4x—ay(8—J) e+ [4g x-+a(s+j)]es = 9, (51)
﻿§72 FINE-STRUCTURE OF THE ENERGY-LEVELS OF HYDROGEN 271

a relation which shows the connexion between the primed and un-
primed c’s,

The boundary condition at r = 0 requires that ry, and rf, > 0 as
r-> 0, so from (46) f and g > 0 as r> 0. Thus the series (49) must
terminate on the side of small s. If s, is the minimum value of s for
which c, and ¢, do not both vanish, we obtain from (50), by putting
$= sande, _, = cy, = 9,

als, + (So td es, = 0, | (52)
X05, — (Sp —J Esy = 0, J
which give o® == —s2+ 7%,

Since the boundary condition requires that the minimum value of s
shall be greater than zero, we must take

89 = bal (7? 0”).
To investigate the convergence of the series (49) we shall determine

the ratio c,/c,_, for large s. Equation (51) and the second of equations
(50) give approximately, when s is large,

be C, = AC,
and SCg == Cy_4/A-+ C4_4/Ap.
Hence C,/Cg4 == 2/as.

The series (49) will therefore converge like

or e/@, This result is similar to that obtained in §39 and allows us
to infer, as in §39, that all values of H’ are permissible for which a
is pure imaginary, ie. from (47), for which. H’ > mc?, while for
H' < mc? we take a to be positive and then find that only those
values of H’ are permissible for which the series (49) terminate on
the side of large s.

If the series (49) terminate with the terms ¢, and c¢,, so that
Cya1 == Cyay == 0, we obtain from (50) with s+1 substituted for s

c,/a,-+¢,/a = 0, (53)

€,[4,+¢,/a = 0.

These two equations are equivalent on account of (47). When com-
bined with (51), they give

ay[da—A_(8—Jj)] = aay e-+-a(s-+9)],

This formula gives the discrete energy-levels of the hydrogen
spectrum and was first obtained by Sommerfeld working with Bohr’s
orbit theory. There are two quantum numbers x and j involved, but
owing to «” being very small the energy depends almost entirely on
n-+-|j|. Values of n and |j| that give the same 2+]j| give rise to a
set of energy-levels lying very close to one another, and to the
energy-level given by the non-relativistic formula (80) of § 39 with
$= n-+(|j|, apart from the constant term me’.

We used equations (53) by combining them with (51), but this does
not make full use of (53) since the coefficients of c, and c, in (51) may
both vanish. In this case we get, multiplying the first coefficient by
a, and the second by a and adding,

a(4,+-,)a+2a,a,j = 0.
Thus j must be negative in this case. With the help of (44) and (47)
we get further

with j negative thus needs further investigation to see whether the

conditions (53) are then fulfilled.
With n = 0, the maximum value of s is the same as the minimum,

so equations (53) with s, substituted for s should agree with (52).
Now (55) gives, from (44) and (47),

1 me V(j2—o)\ 1 ome «

so the first of equations (53) with s, substituted for s gives

This agrees with the second of equations (52) only if 7 is positive.

We can conclude that, for n = 0, j must be a positive integer, while
for the other values of » all non-zero integral values of j are allowed.

73. Theory of the positron

Tt has been mentioned in § 67 that the wave equation for the elec-
tron admits of twice as many solutions as it ought to, half of them
referring to states with negative values for the kinetic energy cp, +eAy.
This difficulty was introduced as soon as we passed from equation (5)
to equation (6) and is inherent in any relativistic theory. It occurs
also in classical relativistic theory, but is not then serious since, owing
to thé continuity in the variation of all classical dynamical variables,
if the kinetic energy cp,+eAy is initially positive (when it must be
greater than or equal to mec?), it cannot subsequently be negative
(when it would have to be less than or equal to —mc?). In the
quantum theory, however, discontinuous transitions may take place,
so that if the electron is initially in a state of positive kinetic energy
it may make a transition to a state of negative kinetic energy. It is
therefore no longer permissible simply to ignore the negative-energy
states, as one can do in the classical theory.

Let us examine the negative-energy solutions of the equation

{(e. 544 v(n. *A,}
x4(P, | 54, cars <4} an me} =0 (56)

a little more closely. For this purpose it is convenient to use a repre-
sentation of the «’s in which all the elements of the matrices repre-
senting oj, wg, and «, are real and all those of the matrix representing

+
﻿274 RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF THE ELECTRON § 73

%, are pure imaginary or zero. Such a representation may be obtained,
for instance, from that of § 67 by interchanging the expressions for a,
and «,, in (9). If equation (56) is expressed as a matrix equation in
this representation and we put —-i for 7 all through it, we get, remem-
bering the ¢ in (4),

€
( Por 74) oa Pit 4)
a Pet 4) a Pst 54) an meh = 0. (57)

Thus each solution # of the wave equation (56) has for its conjugate
complex 7a solution of the wave equation (57). Further, if the solution
# of (56) belongs to a negative value for cpy)+-eA,, the corresponding
solution ¢ of (57) will belong to a positive value for cp,—eA,. But the
operator in (57) is just what one would get if one substituted —e for e
in the operator in (56). It follows that each negative-energy solution
of (56) is the conjugate complex of a positive-energy solution of the
wave equation obtained from (56) by substitution of —e for e, which
solution represents an electron of charge +e (instead of —e, as we
had up to the present) moving through the given electromagnetic field.
Thus the unwanted solutions of (56) are connected with the motion
of an electron with a charge +e. (It is not possible, of course, with
an arbitrary electromagnetic field, to separate the solutions of (58)
definitely into those referring to positive and those referring to negative
values for cp,+-eA, as such a separation would imply that transitions
from one kind to the other do not occur. The preceding discussion is
therefore only a rough one, applying to the case when such a separation

is approximately possible.)

In this way we are led to infer that the negative-energy solutions
of (56) refer to the motion of a new kind of particle having the mass
of an electron and the opposite charge. Such particles have been
observed experimentally and are called positrons. We cannot, how-
ever, simply assert that the negative-energy solutions represent posi-
trons, as this would make the dynamical relations all wrong. For
instance, it is certainly not true that a positron has a negative kinetic
energy. We must therefore establish the theory of the positrons on
a somewhat different footing. We assume that nearly all the negative-
energy states are occupied, with one electron in each state in accordance
with the exclusion principle of Pauli. An unoccupied negative-energy
﻿§ 73 THEORY OF THE POSITRON 275

state will now appear as something with a positive energy, since to
make it disappear, i.e. to fill it up, we should have to add to it an
electron with negative energy. We assume that these wnoccupied
negative-energy states are the positrons.

These assumptions require there to be a distribution of electrons
of infinite density everywhere in the world. A perfect vacuum is a
region where all the states of positive energy are unoccupied and all
those of negative energy are occupied. In a perfect vacuum Maxwell’s

equation div€ =0

must, of course, be valid. This means that the infinite distribution
of negative-energy electrons does not contribute to the electric field.
Only departures from the distribution in a vacuum will contribute
to the electric density 7, in Maxwell’s equation

div € = 47jo. (58)
Thus there will be a contribution —e for each occupied state of posi-
tive energy and a contribution +e for each unoccupied state of
negative energy.

The exclusion principle will operate to prevent a positive-energy
electron ordinarily from making transitions to states of negative
energy. It will still be possible, however, for such an electron to
drop into an unoccupied state of negative energy. In this case we
should have an electron and positron disappearing simultaneously,
their energy being emitted in the form of radiation. The converse
process would consist in the creation of an electron and a positron
from electromagnetic radiation.

From the symmetry between occupied and unoccupied fermion —
states discussed at the end of § 65, the present theory is essentially
symmetrical between the electrons and the positrons. We should
have an equivalent theory if we supposed the positrons to be the
basic particles, described by wave equations of the form (11) with —e
for e, and then supposed that nearly all the states of negative energy
for the positrons are filled up, a hole in the distribution of negative-
energy positrons being then interpreted as an ordinary electron. The
theory could be developed consistently with the hypothesis that all
the laws of physics are symmetrical between positive and negative
electric charge.
