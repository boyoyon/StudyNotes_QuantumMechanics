<h2>74. The electromagnetic field in the absence of matter</h2>
<p>
Tus theory of radiation that was set up in Chapter X involved some
approximations in its handling of the interaction of the radiation
with matter. The object of the present chapter is to remove these
approximations and get, as far as possible, an accurate theory of the
electromagnetic field interacting with matter, subject to the limitation
that the matter consists only of electrons and positrons. Too little is
known about other forms of matter, protons, neutrons, etc., for one
to attempt at the present time to get an accurate theory of their -
interaction with the electromagnetic field. But there exists a precise
theory of electrons and positrons, as given in the preceding chapter,
which one can use for building up a precise theory of the interaction
of the electromagnetic field with this form of matter. The theory
must bring in the interaction of the electrons and positrons with one
another, through their Coulomb forces, as well as their interaction
with electromagnetic radiation, and it must, of course, conform to
special relativity. For brevity in this chapter we shall take c = 1.

We must first consider the electromagnetic field without interaction
with matter. Now in § 63 we set up first a treatment of the field of
radiation without interaction of matter. Dynamical variables were
there introduced to describe the field, commutation relations were
established for them, and a Hamiltonian was found which made them
vary correctly with the time. No approximations were made in this
piece of work. The resulting theory would therefore be a satisfactory,
exact theory of radiation without interaction with matter, were it not
for one feature in it, namely our taking the scalar potential to be zero.
This feature spoils the relativistic form of the theory and makes it
unsuitable as a starting-point from which to develop a precis¢ theory
of the electromagnetic field in interaction with matter.

We must therefore extend the treatment of §63 by leaving A,
general and bringing it into the work along with the other potentials
A,, A,, Aj. Thus we shall have the four 4, and they will satisfy, as
the generalization of (62) of § 63,

; A, = 0, dA,,/Ox, = 0. (1), (2)
For the present we shall ignore the second of these equations.
﻿§ 74 THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD 277

For the present we shall ignore the second of these equations and
work only from the first.

Equation (1) shows that each A, can be resolved into waves
travelling with the velocity of light. Thus, corresponding to equation

(63) of § 63, A,(e) = { (Ae, chr Ae, e~tkn) Bhp, (3)
where k.x denotes the four-dimensional scalar product
k.v = ky, x )—(k,x),

k, being the 4-vector whose space components are the same as the

components of the three-dimensional véctor k of § 63 and whose time
component k, = |k|, and d?k denotes dk, dk, dks, as in § 63. The index

c in the coefficients A¢, indicates that they are constant in time. We

shall later introduce some other Fourier coefficients A,,,, not constant

in time, which must be distinguished from the present ones.

The Fourier component A‘, has a part Aj, coming from A,(x) and

a part A‘, (r = 1,2, 3) which is a three-dimensional vector. The latter

can be decomposed into two parts, a longitudinal part lying in the

direction of k, the direction of motion of the waves, and a transverse

part perpendicular to k. The longitudinal part is k,k,/k,?.Ag,. The

transverse part is

say. It satisfies k, f°, = 0. (5)

It is known from the Maxwell theory of light that only the trans-
verse part is effective for giving electromagnetic radiation. Chapter X
dealt only with this transverse part, the A,, of § 63 being the same as
the present 7%, and equation (65) of § 63 corresponding to the present
equation (5). Nevertheless, the longitudinal part cannot be neglected
in a complete theory of electrodynamics because of its connexion

with the Coulomb forces, as will show up later.
We can now decompose the three-dimensional vector A,(x) into

two parts, a transverse part and a longitudinal part. The former is
Af (a) = [ (tee +L, e-2) Pk

and satisfies b.0,(x)/Ox, = 0. (6)

The longitudinal part may be expressed as the gradient @V/éx, of a
scalar V given by

Vai J Ie| lig? (AS, et? — AS, eth) de, (7)
Thus A, = A+6V /ax,. (8)

3595 57 T
﻿278 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS § 74

The magnetic field is determined by the transverse part of A,,
# = curlA = curl ¥&.

It is convenient to count A,(x) as longitudinal, so that the complete
potentials A,(z) are separated into a transverse part (x) and a
longitudinal part A,, dV/dx,. This separation, of course, refers to a
particular Lorentz frame of reference.and must not be used when one
wants to keep one’s equations in a relativistic form.

Each Fourier coefficient A¢, occurs in (3) combined with the time

factor e%%. The product

. Ao, Etkoty — Aix (9)
say, forms a Hamiltonian dynamical variable in classical mechanics
and a Heisenberg dynamical variable in quantum mechanics, like the
the A,,, of § 63. ;

The work of § 63 gives us the P.B. relations for the transverse part
of A,x. To connect up with it, we pass over to discrete k-values in
three-dimensional k-space and take, for example, a particular discrete
k-value for which hk, = kh, = 0, kg = ky > 0. Then the polarization
variable 1 can take on two values referring to the two directions 1

and 2 and equation (73) of § 63 gives, with the help of the commutation
relations for the y’s and 4’s, equations (11) of § 60,

[AA] = [Ax Art] = —18,/407ky. (10)
The work of §63 gives us no information about Ag, and Ay.
However, we can now obtain the P.B. relations for A,, and A,

from the theory of relativity. Equations (10) have to be built up into
a relativistic set and the only simple way of doing so is by adding to
them the two further equations

(Asx; Asie] = —[Aos Aon] = —t8,/47%ho, (11)
so that the four equations (10) and (11), together with the conditions

that Au and A,, commute for p ~v (as they must do since they
refer to different degrees of freedom), combine to form the single

tensor equation [ As Ay) = 1G yy 84/47 7%. (12)

We get’in this way the P.B. relations for all the dynamical variables.
Equation (12) ean be extended to

[Aus Aye) = yy 5k Syxe/ 477g. (13)

Let us now return to continuous k-values. To convert 6,,, to con-
﻿§ 74 THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD 279

tinuous k-values we note that, for a general function f(k) in three-
dimensional k-space,

SSK) Bey = S06’) = | f(s) 5k —-k) ah, (14)
where 6(k--k’) is the three-dimensional 6 function
B(K—K’) = 8(by—k,)8 (leq —k)8(ey—K5).

In order that (14) may conform to the standard formula connecting
sums and integrals, equation (52) of § 62, we must have

Si Sig == 8(K—K’). (15)

Thus (13) goes over to

[Ayo Ave] == 19,,/477ky d(kK—k’). (16)
This equation, together with the equations

[Aye Aye] = [Aus Ay] = 0, (17)

provide the P.B. relations in the theory with continuous k-values.
It should be noted that these P.B. relations remain valid if we replace
Au Ay by Aix, Aj. The same P.B. relations apply to the constant
Fourier coefficients Ajy, Ajx-

We must now obtain a Hamiltonian which makes each dynamical
variable A,,, vary with the time ¢= a, in the Heisenberg picture
according to the law (9) with Aé, constant. Calling this Hamiltonian
Hp, we require

[Aux Hp] = dA, /day = thy Ay (18)
It is easily seen that this is satisfied by
Hp = —4n? | kA, AY, dk. (19)

We therefore take (19), with the possible addition of an arbitrary
numerical term not involving any dynamical variables, as the Hamil-
tonian for the electromagnetic field in the absence of matter.

In § 63 we used our knowledge of the transverse part of the Hamil-
tonian to obtain the P.B.s of the transverse variables. We have now
applied the reverse procedure to the longitudinal variables, using our
knowledge of their P.B.s, obtained by a relativistic argument, to
find the part of the Hamiltonian, that refers to them so as to get
agreement with (18).

If we write out the Hamiltonian (19) it appears as

Hyp = 4x” | ki Ar Ase + Aoy Aon t+ A ax Ase Aor Lox) ak.
﻿280 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS § 74

The first three terms of the integrand here have a transverse part
which is just equal to the transverse energy given by (71) of § 63.
The last term of the integrand, which is the part of Hy referring to
the scalar potential A), appears with a minus sign. This minus sign
is demanded by relativitv and means that the dynamical system

formed by the variables A,,, 4., is a harmonic oscillator of negative
energy. Itis rather surprising that such an unphysical idea as negative

energy should appear in the theory in this way. We shall see in § 77
that the negative energy associated with the degrees of freedom
connected with A, is always compensated by the positive energy
associated with the other longitudinal degrees of freedom, so that
it never shows up in practice.

75. Relativistic form of the quantum conditions

The theory of the preceding section has relativistic field equations,
namely equations (1). To establish that the theory is fully relativistic
we must show further that the P.B. relations are relativistic. This is
not at all evident from the form (16) in which they are written in
terms of Fourier components. We shall obtain a relativistic form for
the P.B.s by working out [A,,(x), A,(z’)] with x and 2’ any two points
in space-time. We must first, however, study a certain invariant
singular function that exists in space-time.

The function 8(x,, 2") is evidently Lorentz invariant. It vanishes
everywhere except on the light-cone with the origin as vertex, i.e. the
three-dimensional space x, 2" = 0. This light-cone consists of two
distinct parts, a future part, for which x, > 0, and a past part, for which
% <0. The function which equals 3(x,, 2") on the future part of the
light-cone and —8(x, x") on the past part of the light-cone is also
Lorentz invariant. This function, equal to 8(x, v)a/|z9|, plays
an important role in the dynamical theory of fields, so we introduce
a special notation for it. We define

A(x) = 28(2, x)2x9/|2%o|. (20)
This definition gives a meaning to the function A applied to any
4-vector. With the help of (9) of § 15, we can express 6(x,, 2”) in the

form B(x, a) = $x|-48(ary— |x|) +8(2)+|XI)}, (21)

|x| being the length of the three-dimensional part of «,, and then
A(x) takes the form

Ax) = |X|748(%— |X|) —8(%-+ |X])}. (22)
﻿§75 RELATIVISTIC FORM OF THE QUANTUM CONDITIONS 281

A(z) is defined to have the value zero at the origin, and evidently
A(—2z) = —A(z). .

Let us make a Fourier analysis of A(z). Using d*x to denote
dz dx,dx,dx, and dz to denote dz,dx,dx,; we have, for any 4-
vector ky»

| A@e™ dtr =| |x|-B(ay— |X|) —8 (a+ |X|) }etleore—lool fa:
=| |x| ~Letholx! _.¢—thalx!} 9 —a(kx) ax.

By introducing polar coordinates |x|, 9, ¢ in the three-dimensional
2,2, 2%, space, with the direction of the three-dimensional part of k,,
as pole, we get

[ A@et dq = ify {eikalxl_— g~tkolxi}g—ilkiixicos 8 x sin @ dOddd|x|

= 4n°4[k|-4{8(ty— |k |) —3(ko+ IK I)}

= 4n77A(k). (23)
Thus the Fourier analysis gives the same function again, with the
coefficient 4721. Interchanging & and x in (23), we get

A(z) == —i/4n?. | A(kje* dh. (24)

Some of the important properties of A(x) can easily be deduced.
from its Fourier resolution. In the first place equation (24) shows that
A(a) can be resolved into waves all travelling with the velocity of
light. To get an equation for this result we apply the operator [] to
both sides of (24), thus

A(x) = —i/4n®. | A(k)De** dtk = i/4n*. | k, keA(k)e** atk.
fe

Now k, k#A(k),= 0, and hence
A(x) = 0. (25)

This equation holds throughout space-time. We can give a meaning
to (JA(x) at a point where A(x) is singular by taking the integral
﻿282 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS § 75

of [JA(x) over a small four-dimensional space surrounding the point
and transforming it to a three-dimensional surface integral by Gauss’s
theorem. Equation (25) informs us that the three-dimensional surface
integral always vanishes.

The function A(x) vanishes all over the three-dimensional surface
t= 0, Let us determine the value of GA(x)/ax, on this surface. It
evidently vanishes everywhere except at the point 2, = 2, = 2, = 0, -
where it has a singularity which can be evaluated as follows. Differ-
entiating both sides of (24) with respect to 29, we get

6A (a) [Oxy = 1/4n?. | Fo A(hjet= dh
= 1/4a?. [ dg |ke|-45(y— [he |) 8 (leg + Ik Je dt

= 1/4e®. | {8(ibp— ||) +3(ko+ [ke|)}et dh.
Putting x, = 0 on both sides here, we get
[2A (x) /2xrg]oyao = A/4m®. | {8(kg— ||) +5(lby + |k|)}e-1 dh

= 1/2n?, [ e-tte 4%,

== 47 8(2r1)3(ar2)8(a'g) == 47 8(x). (26)

Thus the ordinary 5 singularity, with the coefficient 47, appears at
the point 2, = 2, = 2, = 0.
Let us now evaluate [4,,(x), A,(x’)]. We have from (3), (16), and (17)

[4, (x), A,(e}]

The k, here is defined. to be equal to |k| and is thus always positive.
By putting —k for k in the second part of the integrand, one finds
that (27) is equal to the four-dimensional integral

in which k, takes on all values, negative as well as positive. Evaluating
this with the help of (24), we get finally

[A, (2), A,(@’)] = 9,,A@—2"), (28)
﻿§75 RELATIVISTIC FORM OF THE QUANTUM CONDITIONS 283

a result which shows that the P.B. relations are invariant under
Lorentz transformations.

The formula (28) means that the potentials at two points i in space-
time always commute unless the line joining the two points is a null
line, ie. the track of a light-ray. The formula is consistent with the

field equations (1A,,(x) = 0, because [] applied to the right-hand

side gives zero, from (25).

76. The dynamical variables at one time

As a basis for a theory with interaction we must use the dynamical
variables at one time. The relationships between the dynamical
variables at one time (i.e. their P.B.s) are not affected by the introduc-
tion of interaction. On the other hand the relationships between the
dynamical variables at different times (comprising the field equations
as well as the P.B:s of variables at different times) are very much
affected by the interaction. The dynamical variables at one time form
a non-relativistic concept, but a very important concept in Hamil-
tonian theory.

For the case of the electromagnetic field the independent dynamical
variables at one time are A, and 04,,/@x for all values of 24, ¥q, 3 for
the given 2. The higher time derivatives 2°A,/éu,°,..., are not

independent. Let us put

0A,
B 29
ws By (29)

Then we have Arxs B,x, with the suffix x denoting x, %, £3, a8 the
dynamical variables at one time.

The Fourier resolution of these variables is, from (3) and (9),

Aux = [ (Apt Ay x)eO™ Pk

Bux = | hol Aye—Ay, alot ah
We may reverse the Fourier transformation and express A tA, lk
and A, ,—A,-; in terms of A,, and B,, respectively. Thus 4, and
A pk are determined by 4,,., B, x for all x (at a given 2). The. equa-
tions connecting A,,, Aux with. A,x, By, do not involve the time
explicitly. Thus the A,,,, Aux form an “alternative set of one-time

dynamical variables, on the same footing as the A,x, Bux
When we work with the variables A Bux we shall need to know

(30)

px
﻿284 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS § 76

their P.B. relations. These may be obtained either from the Fourier
expansions (30) together with (16) and (17) or from the general P.B.
relation (28). The latter gives the required results more quickly.
Putting xj = 2%) in (28), we get

[A unr Aye] = 0. (31)

pe

Differentiating (28) with respect to x) and then putting 2 = 2%, we
get, with the help of (26),

Differentiating (28) with respect to both z, and 2 and then putting
2 = Ly, we get [Bux Bye] = 0, (33)

since 6°A(x)/a5 = 0 for 2 = 0. Equations (31), (32), and (33) give
all the P.B. relations between the A px Dy Variables, They show that,
apart from numerical coefficients, the A ux can be looked upon as a set
of dynamical coordinates and the B,,, a8 their conjugate momenta,
there being a 5 function on the right-hand side of (32) instead of a
two-suffix 6 symbol on account of the number of degrees of freedom
being a continuous infinity.

We can decompose A,, into a transverse and a longitudinal part,
as shown by equations (8) and (6). We can do the same with B,, and

get

B=2,48 (34)
Ox,
with 0B, ox, = 0. (35)
From (7) with —k substituted for k in the second term of the integrand,
Vi=i i lig lig 2( Age t+ Ay, )e-*™ Bh. (36)
The corresponding equation for U is, since U = aV /éa,,
U = — | lig lig (A gy — Ay Je Bh, (37)
The electric field is given by
é,=—B, _ aA,

_ g HAD), (38)

Thus divé = 8B, V?Ag
Ox,

It is evident that any longitudinal variable commutes with any
﻿§ 76 THE SCHRODINGER DYNAMICAL VARIABLES 285

transverse variable. Some useful P.B. relations will now be worked
out. We shall use the notation—for any field function f,,

If in (32) we put» = 7, v = 6 and differentiate the equation with
respect to x,, we get
[Bucs Agy'] = 479,,5'(X—X') = —4n59(x—x’),
or, from (39), [div &,, A] = 4765(x—x’). (41)
Now (39) shows that div € is a function only of the longitudinal
variables, so (41) gives
[div &,, V.*] = 478° x—x’) = —478*(x—x’).
Integrating with respect to x, we get
[div €,,V%,] = —413(x—x’), (42)
there being no constant of integration since the field functions &, and °
V, are made up of waves of non-zero wave length. From (42) and (39)

WT. Vo] = 478(x—x’).
Integrating with the help of formula (72) of § 38, we get
(U,V) = —|x—x’|-7, (43)

there being no constant of integration or other terms not vanishing
at infinity on the right-hand side, because U, and Y, are made up of
waves of non-zero wave length. We have from (38) and (43)

[Ee Ve] = [Ug Vy] = — (0,2) |x! |. (44)

9°xX

We shall now obtain the Hamiltonian in terms of the 4,, and B,,
variables. We have from the second of equations (30)

﻿286 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS — § 76
Adding and dividing by —87, we get
—(8m)-2 | (B, BeAr Aer) dix
= —27? J leg(A ye AM + Aye AY 4) Bh.
This is equal to A, given by (19), apart from an infinite numerical

term. The formula (19) for 2, already involves an arbitrary numerical
term, so we may take

Hyp = —(87)-2 | (B,, Bu-+-A,7A*) dx (45)

with an arbitrary numerical term, different from that of (19).

The Hamiltonian (45) can, of course, be used to give the Heisenberg
equations of motion, and the arbitrary numerical term in it does not
have any effect. One can easily check, using (31), (32) and (33), that

0A,,/0% = [A,, Hp] = B,, (46)
and. 6B,,/0x% = [B,, Hp] = VA,,
agreeing with (29) and (1). It also gives the Schrédinger equation of
motion ihd|P)|day = Hy|P>

for a ket |P> representing a state in the Schrédinger picture. The
arbitrary numerical term here has the effect of changing |P> by a
phase factor, which is not of physical importance.

We can decompose the expression (45) for H, into a transverse
part Hp, and a longitudinal part H,,;. We have from (34)

| BB, Bz = | (B,+ UY B,+U") Ba

= | BB, Bx + | UrUr dx,
since the cross terms vanish on account of
[ 0, Ba = — [ UB? dx =0
from (35). Similarly we have from (8)
| AfA,? Ba = { bhiof8 Ba + | preyre d3z,

with the cross terms vanishing again. Thus (45) becomes
Ap = ppt Hpy,

with Hyp = (80)"} | (B, B+ Al) Be (47)
and = Hy; = (8m)-2 | (UrUt- VrsVr*— B, By—A Ag’) Gx. (48)
﻿§ 76 THE SCHRODINGER DYNAMICAL VARIABLES 287
it should be noted that the term
(87) [ feeds da
in Hyp can be transformed to

= (Sn) | cfslohs—ahe) Pa

so this term is just the magnetic energy. Some further partial inte-

grations give
| Vrsyrs io = | prryss Bx,

so (48) may be written

Hy, = (8m) [ {(U—Ag¥(U + Ag+ (V"—By)(V"+ By)} Bx. (49)

77. The supplementary conditions

We must now go back to the Maxwell equation (2), which we have
ignored so far. We cannot take this equation over directly into the
quantum theory without getting inconsistencies. The left-hand side
of the equation does not commute with A,(x’), according to the
quantum conditions (28), so this left-hand side cannot vanish. The
way out of the difficulty was shown by Fermi.} It consists in adopting
a less stringent equation, namely the equation

(0A,,/2x,,)|P> = 9, (50)
and assuming it to hold for any | P> corresponding to a state that can
actually occur in nature. There is one equation (50) for each point
in space-time and these equations must all hold for any ket corre-
sponding to a state that can actually occur.

We shall call a condition such as (50), which a ket has to satisfy to
correspond to an actual state, a supplementary condition. The exis-
tence of supplementary conditions in the theory does not mean any
departure from or modification in the general principles of quantum
mechanics. The principle of superposition of states and the whole of
the general theory of states, dynamical variables, and observables,
as given in Chapter II, apply also when there are supplementary

+ Fermi, Reviews of Modern Physics, 4 (1932), 125.
﻿288 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS § 77

conditions, provided we impose a further requirement on a linear
operator in order that it may represent an observable. We define a
linear operator to be physical if it has the property that, when it.
operates on any ket satisfying the supplementary conditions, it pro-
duces another ket satisfying the supplementary conditions. In order
that a linear operator may represent an observable it must evidently
satisfy the requirement of being physical, in addition to the require-
ments of § 10.

We have already had an example of supplementary conditions in
the theory of systems containing several similar particles. The con-
dition that only symmetrical wave functions, or only antisymmetrical
wave functions, represent states that can actually occur in nature, is
precisely of the samé type as condition (50) and is what we are now
calling a supplementary condition. In this theory the requirement
that a linear operator shall be physical is that it shall be symmetrical
between the similar particles.

When we introduce supplementary conditions into our theory we
must verify that they are consistent, i.e. not too restrictive to allow
any ket at all to satisfy them. Ifwe have more than one supplementary
condition, we can deduce further supplementary conditions from them
by taking P.B.s of the operators in them; thus if we have

U|P>=0, V\|P>=90, (51)
we can deduce

[U,V]|P>=9,  [U,[U, VI]|P> = 0, (52)

and so on. To verify that our supplementary conditions are consistent
we have to look into all the further supplementary conditions obtain-
able by this procedure to see that they can be satisfied, which we can
usually do by showing that after a certain point the further supple-
mentary conditions are all either identically satisfied or repetitions
of the previous ones.

We must also verify that the supplementary conditions are in agree-
ment with the equations of motion. In the Heisenberg picture, for
which the ket | P) in (51) is fixed, we shall have different supplementary
conditions referring to different times and they must all be consistent,
in the way discussed above. In the Schrodinger picture, for which the
ket |P> varies with the time inaccordance with Schrédinger’s equation,
we require that if |P) satisfies the supplementary conditions initially
it satisfies them always. This means that d|P)/dé must satisfy the
﻿§ 77 THE SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS 289

supplementary conditions, or that H|P> must satisfy the supplemen-
tary conditions, or that H must be physical.
It is convenient when we have asupplementary condition U|P> =0

to write U0 (53)

and to call (53) a weak equation, in distinction to an ordinary or strong
equation. A weak equation gives another weak equation if it is
multiplied by any factor on the left, but does not in general give a valid
equation if it is multiplied by a factor on the right. Thus a weak
equation must not be used in working out P.B.s. With this way of
speaking, the requirement (52) that the supplementary conditions are
consistent becomes the requirement that the P.B.s of the operators
in the supplementary conditions shall vanish weakly.

The condition for a dynamical variable é to be physical is that, for
each supplementary condition 7|P> = 0, we have

Ug|P> = 0,
and hence [U,é]|P> = 0.

Thus the condition is that the P.B. of the dynamical variable with
each of the operators of the supplementary conditions shall vanish

weakly.
Let us now return to electrodynamics. We take equation (2) to be

a weak equation, so it should be written

0A ,/Ox, = 0. (54),
In the Heisenberg picture we have one of these equations for each
point x. To check their consistency, we take two arbitrary points x
and 2’ in space-time and form the P.B.

[eu Se) gly) AND)

Oat, a, On, OX,

Evaluating it with the help of (28), we get

from (25), so the requirements for consistency are satisfied strongly.
As we have verified that the supplementary conditions are consistent
at all times in the Heisenberg picture, we have verified that they are
in agreement with the equations of motion.

Since equation (54) is only a weak equation, any of its consequences
﻿290 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS §77

in the ordinary Maxwell theory will be valid in the quantum theory
only as weak equations. The equations

divA! = 0, dF /ét = —curl €

follow simply from the definitions of € and# in terms of the potentials,
so they are valid strongly in the quantum theory. The other Maxwell
equations for empty space, namely

divé = 0, d&/at ~ curl#, (55)

are weak equations in the quantum theory, because one needs the
help of (54) as well as (1) in deriving them.

The field quantities € and # are components of the antisymmetric
tensor 0A”/dx,—dAr/dx,. The P.B. of the tensor with the operator
of (54) at a general point x’ is

Higher differentiations with respect to x) do not give independent
equations, but equations which are consequences of these and the
strong equation (1). Thus in terms of the Schrédinger variables of
§ 76, the supplementary conditions are

BytAy = (57)
and (A jt+B,) = 0. (58)

Equation (58) is the same as the first of equations (55) and may also
be written, from (39),

V%(Ag+U) = 0.

Since this holds throughout three-dimensional space, it leads to

A,+U = 0. (59)
Noting that A,” = V"", we can now see from (49) that
Hyp 0. (60)

Thus there ts no longitudinal field energy for states that occur in nature.
﻿§77 THE SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS 291

To set up a convenient representation, we introduce a standard ket
[0,> satisfying the supplementary conditions

(BtAs)0p> =0, — (Ap +-U)|0p> = 0, (61)
and also satisfying Ay|\On> = 0. - (62)

These conditions are consistent, because Ay, commutes with the
operators in (61), and they are sufficient to fix |0,> completely, apart
from a numerical factor, because the only independent dynamical
variables that we have are Ay, By, U, A,’, %,, Z,, and of these
A,+U, By+A,’, %, form a complete commuting set. With this
standard ket we can express any ket as

‘P(A; Bo, Gx) |0n>. (63)

Our representation is just the Fock representation so far as concerns
the transverse dynamical variables 4,, 7,, so Y must be a power
series in the variables %,, with different terms in the series corre-
sponding to the presence of different numbers of photons. The number
of variables occurring in ¥ is a continuous infinity, so ¥ is what
mathematicians call a ‘functional’.

If the ket (63) satisfies the supplementary conditions, ‘ must be
independent of A, and By, and thus a function only of the o7,,. So
physical states are represented by kets of the form

F(4) On», (64)

with a power series in the variables %,. The standard ket |0,>
itself represents the physical state with no photons present, the perfect
vacuum.

Our Hamiltonian H, and its parts Hy,, Hpp have so far contained
arbitrary numerical terms. It is convenient to choose these terms so
that Hy,, Hpp are zero for the perfect vacuum. The result (60) shows
that Hp; given by (48) or (49) has the numerical term in it correctly
chosen to make Hp; have the value zero for the perfect vacuum, as
well as for every other physical state. We must take Hpr to be

App = 47° | he? ye Ay, Ph, (65)

the transverse part of (19), in order that the numerical term in it may
be correctly chosen to give no zero-point energy for the photons.
(47) differs from (65) by an infinite numerical term, consisting of a
half-quantum of energy for each photon state.
﻿292 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS § 78

78. Electrons and positrons by themselves

We now consider electrons and positrons in the absence of electro-
magnetic field. The state of an electron is described, as in Chapter XI,
by a wave function % with four components #, (a = 1, 2, 3, 4), satis-
fying the wave equation

th, im, ah ox, Ban be Xp, Ha (66)

Tr
To get a many-electron theory we shall apply the method of second’
quantization of § 65, which involves changing the one-electron wave
function into a set of operators satisfying certain anticommutation
relations.

When we are dealing with at various places at a given time we
may write it ¢,, with x denoting 2,, x, x5. Its components are then
tu, We pass to the momentum representation with the wave function

#, has four components y¥,,, corresponding to the four components
of #,. In this representation the energy operator is

Po = Oy Dp Xm Ms
in which the momentum operators p, are multiplying factors.
We can separate y into a positive-energy part € and a negative-

energy part ¢, p= ELL,

€ and ¢ each having four components like J. In the momentum
representation they are given by

I 7 Ppt Xm, M
bp = 5 14 recency ho op _

since these equations lead to
Bobp = (% Pp tom ME, = Hot Ppt Om M+ (D?-+-m*) hh,
(p?+m*)ié,,
and similarly Dob = —(p?-+m?)iE,,
showing that &, and ©, are eigenfunctions of p, with the eigenvalues

(p?-m?)? and —(p?-+-m?)! respectively. When one is working with
the operators

one should note that their squares are equal to themselves and their
product in either order is zero.

The second quantization makes the ’s into operators like the 4’s
of § 65, satisfying anticommutation relations like (11’) of § 65. Using
the notation for the anticommutator

MN+NM = [M,N },, (69)
we get _ + _
[Loses Pore + — 0, [Leas Pr le —_ 0, (70)
[Laxs dow le = Sap 6(x—x’),

the function 5(x— x’) appearing in the last equation owing to the x’s
taking on continuous ranges of values. On transforming to the p-
representation according to (67), we get

[Laps Pop |e = 0, [Pap» Pop ls = 0,
[Lap Pr ls = 5,,5(P— Pp’).
With é and ¢ defined again by (68), the last of equations (71) gives

and similarly

and [fap lop le = [Enp> lop le = 0.

According to the interpretation of §65, the operators ,, are
operators of annihilation of an electron of momentum p and the
operators ¢,, are operators of creation of an electron of momentum p.
To avoid the unphysical notion of negative-energy electrons, we must
pass over to a new interpretation based on the positron theory of § 73.
The annihilation of a negative-energy electron is to be understood as
the creation of a hole in the sea of negative-energy electrons, or the
creation of a positron. So the operators ¢,, become operators of
creation of a positron. The positron has the momentum — p, because
an amount p of momentum gets annihilated. Similarly the £,,, become
operators of annihilation of a positron of momentum —p. The €,,
and £,, are operators of annihilation and creation respectively of an
ordinary, positive-energy electron of momentum p.

﻿294 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS § 78

It should be noted that, although €, has four components, only
two of them are independent, because the four are connected by

p ele, — 0,

(p?-+-m?)!
which involves two independent equations. The two independent
components of €, correspond to the annihilation of an electron in
each of the two independent states of spin. Similarly ¢, has only
two independent components, because of the equations

te Etat lt = 0,

and they correspond to the creation of a positron in the two inde-

pendent states of spin.
The vacuum state, for which there are no electrons or positrons

present, is represented by the ket |0p) satisfying
We can use this ket as the standard ket of a representation. We then
have any ket expressed as

Y(Eap> Cap) 9p),
in which the function, or rather functional, ‘¥ is a power series in the
variables £,,, Cap. Hach term of ¥ is like (17') of § 65. It must not
contain any ofits variables to a higher power than the first. It corre-
sponds to the existence of certain (positive-energy) electrons and
certain positrons, in states specified by the labels of the variables
appearing in it.

From (12’) of § 65, the total number of electrons is | Pap tap dp
summed over a, We may write it in the notation of equation (12) of
§ 67 as { ¢i), Bp. Transforming it to the x-representation by (67),
we get
be [[f iomhe tort dhe Pad e'dp = | Phx de,

showing that the density of the electrons is gi 4,. This result includes
an infinite constant representing the density of the sea of negative-

energy electrons.

We get a quantity of more physical significance if we take the total
charge Q, equal to the number of positive-energy electrons minus the
number of holes or positrons, all multiplied by —e. Thus

Q=—e| (e—-GG) a. (75)
﻿§ 78 ELECTRONS AND POSITRONS BY THEMSELVES 295

We can evaluate this with the help of (68). Using the transpose of
the second of these equations, namely

Now for any matrix a whose cova sum is zero, the anticommutation
relations (71) give

Hh, cy pt, oth, = oan(Pap Pop + Pop bap) = qq O(P— P’) = 0, (76)
a result which we may assume still holds for p’ = p. Then the
expression for Q reduces to

Q= —2{ Mohd, op Fp) ap.
Transforming it to the x-representation as before, we get
Q=—e[ Mid —ved,) Oe,
showing that the charge density is
The interpretation of the one-electron wave function in § 68 gives,
besides the probability density ft, a probability current Plo, yp.
With second quantization we shall have correspondingly a flow of

electrons, given by the operator fia,y,. The sea of negative-energy
electrons produces no resultant flow of electrons, from symmetry,

and so the electric current is

™ —erp, Oy Pigs (78)
The total energy of the electrons is, from formula (29) of § 60, which
is valid also for fermions,

Hp = | bh Do}, Pp = | Pt (ot, Dpto mb, Ep. (79)
It becomes, when transformed to the x-representation,
Hy = [ Pil —itiags,!-+ay my) Bx. (80)

This total energy contains an infinite numerical term representing

the energy of the sea of negative-energy electrons.
We get a quantity of more physical significance if we take the energy
﻿296 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS § 78

of all the electrons and positrons, reckoning the energy of the vacuum
as zero. This quantity is

Hp = : (pm)? a +042,) dp (81)
oo pesnmlo

+ | (P+ m) AT bp toh Dy) Bp. (82)

From (76), the first integral in (82) is the same as (79) and is just
Hp. The second integral is an infinite constant and is minus the
energy of all the negative-energy electrons of the vacuum distribution.

We may take either Hp or Hp. as the Hamiltonian. The Heisenberg
equation of motion for %,, is thus

Oax/ Oty = [Pars Hy| = = [Paxs Hp],

and if we work this out we just get back to the wave equation for +,
namely (66).

We must now look into the question of whether the theory is
relativistic. It is built up from operators 4 which satisfy the field
equations (66). These equations are the same as the wave equation
for the one-electron wave function and are known to be invariant

under Lorentz transformations, provided % transforms according to
the law (20) of Chapter XI. Our present theory goes beyond the
one-electron theory in that anticommutation relations are introduced
for the %’s and #’s, and it becomes necessary to verify that these
anticommutation relations are Lorentz invariant.

We proceed by a method analogous to that of § 75. We take two
general points x and 2’ in space-time and form the anticommutator

Kay (a, 2") = pale) a") + byl’ fal). (83)

We can evaluate it by working directly from the anticommutation
relations (71) for the Fourier components of ys and J. A simpler way
is to note certain properties that K,,(x,a’) must have, namely

(i) it involves x, and vy only through their difference ty 25
﻿§ 78 ELECTRONS AND POSITRONS BY THEMSELVES 297

(ii) it satisfies the wave equation

a a
i — ih — “—
(it a, the, én, Qn m) Kel x)= 0 (84)

on account of %(x) satisfying (66);
(iii) for vy) = a it has the value §,,5(x—x’), as follows from the

third of equations (70).
These properties are sufficient to fix K,,(x, x’) completely, since (iii)
fixes it for 2) = 2%, (ii) shows how it depends on 2p, and (i) then shows
how it depends on 2. The solution is easily seen to be

where the >’ means a summation over the two values +(p?+m?)} for
py with particular values for p,, D2, p3- Tt satisfies (ii) since the operator
in (84) produces the factor (p)—a,~,—%,_,m) in the integrand of
(85), which factor gives zero when multiplied on the left into the
factor {}. It satisfies (iii) since, with x) = 2, the summation over py
makes the second term in {} cancel out.

The law of transformation for and ¢ given in § 68 has the effect
of making the quantities £'(x')a,, (x) transform like the four com-
ponents of a 4-vector and making #1(2’)o,, (x) invariant. Thus

Leaf (20! )ow,, x(x) + SBE (ar! Jory, (a) (86)
is invariant with l# any 4-vector and S any scalar. The invariance |

of (86) must be sufficient to ensure the correct transformation law
for and ys, since it enables one to deduce the invariance of the wave

equation for %, by taking l+ = th d/éx,, S = —m.
The invariance of (86) leads to the invariance of

(Woy + Seem )avl Pal’ yoo(%) +p (e)Pq(@’)}.
Thus (Ha, + Son)ap Kyal%, 2’) (87)

should be invariant with K,,(x,x’) given by (85), and its invariance
would be sufficient to ensure the invariance of the anticommutation

relations. We get for (87)

This is Lorentz invariant because the differential element pz! d°p is
﻿298 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS § 78

Lorentz invariant. Thus the relativistic invariance of the theory is
proved.

79. The interaction

The complete Hamiltonian for electrons and positrons interacting
with the electromagnetic field is

H = Hp+Hp+Ho, (89)

where Hy, is the Hamiltonian for the electromagnetic field alone,
given by (19) or (45), Hp is the Hamiltonian for the electrons and
positrons alone, given by (80) or (81), and Hp is the interaction energy,
involving the dynamical variables of the electrons and positrons as
well as those of the electromagnetic field. We take

Ho = Ary, dx, . (90)
with j, given by (77) and (78), as we shall see that this gives the correct
equations of motion. Thus, with neglect of infinite numerical terms,

H = [ (Bag —itr—ed"p) + Pray mp JeAPY— PP} de —
—(87)-2 | (B, Bet A,tAv) dx. (91)

Let us work out the Heisenberg equations of motion that follow
from the Hamiltonian (91}. We have

iT Bhg| Oh = thayg H— Hag. = Way (Hp + Ho) —(Hp-+ Ho Wax

= / [Leases Pox’) +{a,( ~— tial” —eA ** by) +

Thus {2u{ +e) oy, ml = 0. (92)
This agrees with the one-electron wave equation (11) of Chapter XT.
Since H is real, the equation of motion for ¢ will be the conjugate of
the equation of motion for y and so will agree with (12) of Chapter XT.
Thus the interaction (90) gives correctly the action of the field on the
electrons and positrons. Further we have, making use of the P.B.

relations in (46),

(93) and (94) lead to A, = 40), (95)

which agrees with the Maxwell theory and shows that the interaction
(90) gives correctly the action of the electrons and positrons on the
field.

To complete the theory we must bring in the supplementary con-
ditions (54). We must verify that they are in agreement with the
equations of motion. The method used in § 77, which consisted in
showing that the supplementary conditions at different times in the
Heisenberg picture are consistent with one another, is no longer
applicable, because the quantum conditions connecting dynamical
variables at different times get altered by the interaction in a way
that is too complicated to be worked out. So we shall obtain all the
supplementary conditions affecting the dynamical variables at one
instant of time and check whether they are consistent.

We have again equations (56). A further differentiation with respect

to %» gives ~
oo . dA, /ex, = 0. (96)

Now the equation of motion for , namely (92), leads, as in § 68, to

a(hta,, p)/ax, = 0,
This is the same as j,/0x, = 9, (97)

because the difference between —ezitys and j, is constant in time, even
though it is infinite. From (95) we now see that (96) holds as a strong
equation. Thus equations (56) are the only independent supplemen-
tary conditions affecting the dynamical variables at one instant of
time. The first of them gives (57), as before, and the second now gives,
with the help of (95) for » = 0,

(A,?+B,) +4rjy = 0. (98)
This may be written

(A> tU)’+4nj, 0 (99)
or, from (39), div €—4nj, = 0, (100)

and is just one of the Maxwell equations.
﻿300 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS § 79

One can see without detailed calculation that, for any two points

x and 2’ at the same time,

[Jox>Jox'] = 9,

since, from the form of (70), the P.B. must be a multiple of 5(x—x’)
and cannot contain derivatives of 5(x— x’), while also it has to be anti-
symmetrical between x and x’. Thus the extra terms 47j), in equa-
tions (98) for various values of x, as compared with the corresponding
equations (58), commute with one another as well as with all the
other dynamical variables occurring in (58) and (57). It follows that
these extra terms will not disturb the consistency of (58) and (57),
and hence (98) and (57) are consistent.

Our method of introducing interaction into the theory was not
relativistic, since the interaction energy (90) involves the dynamical
variables at an instant of time in some Lorentz frame. It therefore
becomes questionable whether the theory with interaction is a rela-
tivistic one. Our field equations, namely (92) and (95), are evidently
relativistic and so are the supplementary conditions (54). It remains
uncertain whether the quantum conditions are Lorentz invariant.

We know the quantum conditions connecting all our dynamical
variables A,,., Buss Wax bay, at a given time x. We cannot, as men-
tioned above, work out the general quantum conditions connecting
dynamical variables at any two points in space-time, because the
interaction makes it too complicated. We shall therefore make an
infinitesimal Lorentz transformation and work out the quantum con-
ditions at a given time in the new frame of reference. If we can estab-
lish that the quantum conditions are invariant under infinitesimal
Lorentz transformations, their invariance under finite Lorentz trans-
formations will follow.

Let x* be the time coordinate in the new frame of reference. It is
connected with the original coordinates by

LE = Lyter,2,, (101)
where ec is an infinitesimal number and », is a three-dimensional vector,
ev, being the relative velocity of the two frames. We shall neglect
terms of order «?.

A field quantity « at the place x at the time x} in the new frame
has the value
K(X, @G) = K(X, %q)+ (uF —2) On, /x, = K(X, Xp) ev, a, [k,, A].

[x Ay] or anticommutator [x,,A,],, a8 the case may be, is a number,
and so the last term in (103) or (104) vanishes. We are left with

[e(X, xO), A(X’, xo) 1. = [«(X, 2X); A(x’, 2%) 144°

+€v,(2,—2,)[ xs [Axes Hp + Her], + €(2,— 4) [x Aw Hola, (105)
where [x,A], denotes the P.B. or the anticommutator, as the case may
be. From the form (90) for Hg we see that [A,,, Hy] can involve only
the dynamical variables A,,.-, fax’s $a, and cannot involve any deriva-
tives of these variables. It follows that [k,, [A,, Hg]].., if it does not
vanish, will be a multiple of 8(x— x’) and will not contain terms with
derivatives of 5(x—x’). Hence the last term of (105) vanishes. We
can conclude that [«(x, 2%),A(x’,v%)], has the same value as when
there is no interaction, and is thus Lorentz invariant from our earlier

work.

A possible criticism of the above proof'should be noted. At several
places we worked out expressions in powers of « and neglected ¢?.
Such a procedure cannot be valid for calculating [k(x),A(z’)], with «
and a’ two general points in space-time lying close together, so that
€y— Ly is of order «, because the result of the calculation should be
a function of the (x,—«',)’s having a singularity when the 4-vector
a—z’ lies on the light-cone and such a function, of course, cannot be

ep
expanded as a power series in the (x,—a,)’s.

﻿302 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS § 79

To validate the argument we should reformulate it so as to avoid
the use of the 6 function. Instead of evaluating [x(x, 7), A(x’, x%)],.,
we should evaluate

[ J ae te(x. ach) da, [by ACK, 28) Bx] , (106)

+

where a, and b, are two arbitrary continuous functions of 2,, Zp, X3.
Then the quantities that we need to expand in powers of « all vary
continuously with a continuous change in the direction of the time-
axis, and the expansions are justifiable. The equations that we now
get are those of the previous argument multiplied by a,b, d?xd32'
and integrated. We are led to the same conclusion—that the P.B.
or anticommutator has the same value as when there is no interaction.

It will be seen that the reason why the interaction does not disturb
the quantum conditions is because it is so simple, involving only the
basic dynamical variables and not their derivatives. The P.B.s and
anticommutators have the same values as with no interaction pro-
vided they refer to variables at two points in space-time that are at
the same time with respect to some observer. This means the two
points must be outsidé each other’s light-cones and may approach
coincidence only along a path lying outside the light-cone.

80. The physical variables
A ket |P> that represents a physical state must satisfy the supple-

mentary conditions

(By+A,")|P) = 0, (div €—4ij,)|P> = 0. (107)

A dynamical variable is physical if, when multiplied into any ket

satisfying these conditions, it gives another ket satisfying these con-
ditions. This requires that it shall commute with the quantities

B,+A,, div €—4ij,. (108)

Let us see what simple dynamical variables have this property.

The transverse field variables 4, #, evidently commute with the
quantities (108) and are physical. The variable 4, commutes with
the first of the quantities (108) but not the second and is thus not
physical. We have

Mars Pr Dox = (tax Doe toy: Barbe?
: = Sap 8(X— X’ bry: = Pax (X—X’).
Thus [baxrSow] = 4e/Hi Wag 5(X—X'). (109)
﻿§ 80 THE PHYSICAL VARIABLES 303

From (42)
[eiePalt, div 6,.] = Arvie/fi.c%”2!"8(x—x’).
Hence

[e* V xl as div ey —_ Arrjoy:| = [e% Yall, div EO Wax — drrete lh [bar Jox’]

Thus if we put fix = CM alhh (110)

$*, commutes with both expressions (108) and is physical. Similarly
ot, is physical. The variables 4, Z,, $*, $* are the only independent
physical variables, apart from the quantities (108) themselves.

We have

Thus the charge density and current are physical. Also it is easily
seen that € and # are physical, just as in the case when there are
no electrons and positrons present. All those variables are physical
that are unaffected by the arbitrariness that exists in the electro-
magnetic potentials in the Maxwell theory.

The operator ¢%,, represents the creation of a positron or the
annihilation of an electron at the piace x. Let us see what is the
physical significance of the operator Y*,. From (44)

ihfeteralt, C,.] = celePal(x,—a1)/x—x’ |,
and hence this Eng | = eb, (4,—2,)|K— x’ | F
or Org! Pix = Parl Ere + (Lp —2,) |X! — x|-3}. (1 12)

Take a state |P) for which €, at a certain point x’ certainly has the
numerical value c,, so that

€,4|P) = ¢,|P).
Then from (112)

Ore! bax|P) — {c, : e(2, ,) |X x|3}bax|P),
so for the state Y%.|P), €, at the point x’ certainly has the value

C+ e (a —a,.) |X’ — x |,

This means that the operator i7,., besides creating a positron or annihi-
lating an electron at the point x, increases the electric field at the
point x’ by e(w,—2,)|x’—x[-°, which is just the classical Coulomb
field at x’ of a positron with chatge e at the point x. Thus the operator
$3, creates a positron at the point x together with tis Coulomb field,
or else annihilates an electron at x together with its Coulomb field.

- For electrons and positrons interacting with the electromagnetic

field it is the variables ¥*, {*, rather than the variables ¢, J, that
correspond to the physical processes of creation and annihilation of
electrons and positrons, since these processes must always be accom-
panied by the appropriate Coulomb change in the electric field around
the point where the particle is created or annihilated. It is easily seen
that the variables %,, #%, satisfy the same anticommutation relations
(70) as the unstarred variables. When we pass to the momentum
representation the important quantities will be, not the unphysical
variables 4, defined by (67), but the physical variables 4% defined by

pe = h-i | eiemnys Bp, fk = ht [ entry dx. (113)
We must now replace (68) by
1 Oy P+ a, 7) 5, 1 Op Deb Lay,
eo * _ *
& 5! ae ea ct p (p2-bm2)F Yip»
and take & to represent the annihilation of an electron of momentum
p, & the creation of an electron of momentum p, 5 the creation of
a positron of momentum —p and ¢* the annihilation of a positron
of momentum —p. The variables ut, J%, &, E, Cf, T* will all satisfy
the same anticommutation relations as the corresponding unstarred
variables.

We can express the Hamiltonian entirely in terms of physical
variables. We have

pr = cM icf. Vp).

Thus .
Hp-+ Hg = | (pte —itiy eof" — Vr] tft, map-+-AY%jg} dx

with the help of (99). Thus

Integrating (99) with the help of formula (72) of § 38, we get

﻿§ 80 THE PHYSICAL VARIABLES 305

and hence

H, A%. Ba mz JoxJox’ gud dqy’.
Thus we get H = H*
with

Ht = | (pita, (itp — esd) + Pq mp} Part

1 JoxJox’
i - OxJ/ 0x Bayan!
Herts | | 2 x eee (114)

We may use H* instead of H as our Hamiltonian. It leads to tne
same Schrodinger equation for a physical ket, since if |P> is physical
H*|PS = A\P).

Also it leads to the same Heisenberg equations of motion for physical

variables, since if € is a physical variable

[6 H*] = [, A>
Thus H* and H are equivalent Hamiltonians for the physical quanti-
ties, and the others do not matter.

H* involves only physical variables. The longitudinal field variables
do not appear in it. Instead of them we have the last term of (114),
which is just the Coulomb interaction energy of any charges that are
present. The appearance of such a term in a relativistic theory is
rather strange, as it is an energy associated with the instantaneous
propagation of forces. It appears as a result of our having transformed
the theory a long way from the Heisenberg form in which the relati-
vistic invariance of the theory is manifest.

We could set up a representation by taking as standard ket the
product of the standard ket |0,> for the electromagnetic field alone,
given by (61) and (62), with the standard ket |0p> for the electrons
and positrons alone, given by (74). This representation would not be
a convenient one, however, because its standard ket does not satisfy
the second of the supplementary conditions (107 ).

We get a more convenient representation if we take another stan-

dard ket |Q) satisfying
(By+4,")\Q> = 0, (div €—4njy)|@> = 0, (115)
Dy\Q>=0, EIQ = 0, Lay @> = 0. (116)

These conditions are consistent, because the operators on |Q> in

them all commute or anticommute with each other, and there are
enough of them to fix |Q) completely, apart from a numerical factor,
﻿306 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS § 80

because there are as many of them as of the conditions for |0,)|0p).
The conditions (115) show that |@Q> satisfies the supplementary con-
ditions and so represents a physical state. The conditions (116) show
that |Q> represents a state for which there are no photons, electrons,
or positrons present.

Any ket |P> that satisfies the supplementary conditions (107) and
so represents a physical state can be expressed as some physical
variable multiplied into |Q>. The only independent physical vari-

ables that give non-vanishing results when applied to [Q> are

rk?
fap Cap. Hence

|P> = Ya, ee ap) |@Q>- (117)

Thus |.P> isrepresented by a wave functional ¥ involving the variables
t,,, E*,, Ct. It is a power series in these variables, the various terms
in it corresponding to the existence of various numbers of photons,
electrons, and positrons, with the Coulomb fields around the electrons
and positrons.

Tn using the representation (117) together with the Hamiltonian H *
we have a form of the theory in which we can ignore the conditions.
(115), as,they have no effect on the kets (117). We must retain the

conditions (116). The longitudinal variables then no longer appear
in the theory. |

81. Interpretation

The foregoing work establishes the basic equations of quantum
electrodynamics. There are two forms of the theory, involving the
Hamiltonians H and H* respectively. We must now: consider the
interpretation and application of the theory. We shall take the H*
form for definiteness. The argument would be essentially the same
with the 7 form. )

The ket |Q> represents a state for which there are no photons,
electrons, or positrons present. One would be inclined to suppose this
state to be the perfect vacuum, but it cannot be, because it is not
stationary. For it to be stationary we should need to have

A*IQ> = CQ)

with C a number. Now H* contains the terms

—e | Ptta, fr Pe +5 { [ deste areata’, (118)

x—-x"|

which do not give numerical factors when applied to |Q>) and which
therefore spoil the stationary character of IQ.
﻿§ 81 DIFFICULTIES OF THE THEORY 307

Let us call the state @ represented by |Q> the no-particle state at
a certain time. If we start with the no-particle state it does not remain
the no-particle state. Particles get created where none previously
existed, their energy coming from the interaction part of the Hamil-

tonian.
To study this spontaneous creation of particles, we take the ket

|Q> as initial ket in the Schrodinger picture and treat the terms (118)
as a perturbation giving rise to a probability of the state Q jumping
into another state, in accordance with the theory of §44. The first of
them, resolved into its Fourier components, contains a part

—~e(aan [| 7 Eh Bossa Phd, (119)

which causes transitions in which a photon is emitted and simul-
taneously an electron-positron pair is created. After a short time
the transition probability is proportional to the squared length of the
ket formed by multiplying (119) into the initial ket |Q>, which is

x [oop Sep lea psa SFpsenle|@> Phd? pdrh'd?p’.

Using the values of the P.B. and anticommutators given by (4), (16),
(72), (73), we get an integrand which depends on the k, k’ variables
according to the law |k|-18(k~—-k’) for large values of k and k’. This
gives an integral that diverges, so the transition probability is infinite.

The second term of (118), resolved into its Fourier components,
contains terms like & &%, Cf. CF. yp, which cause transitions in which
two electron-positron pairs are created simultaneously. One can
calculate the transition probability as before, and one finds again
that it is infinite. From these calculations one can conclude that the
state Q is not even approximately stationary.

A theory which gives rise to infinite transition probabilities of
course cannot be correct. We can infer that there is something wrong
with quantum electrodynamics. This result need not surprise us,
because quantum electrodynamics does not provide a complete
description of nature. We know from experiment that there exist
other kinds of particles, which can get created when large amounts of

energy are available. All that we can expect from a theory of quantum
﻿308 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS § 81

electrodynamics is that it shall be valid for processes in which there
is not enough energy available for these other particles to be created
to an appreciable extent, say for energies up to a few hundred MeV.
Thus the high-energy part of the interaction energy (118) is quite
unreliable, and it is this high-energy part that is responsible for the
infinities.

It appears that we must modify the high-energy part of the inter-
action. At present there does not exist any detailed theory of the other
particles and so it is not possible to say how it ought to be modified.
The best we can do is to cut it out from the theory altogether, and so
remove the infinities. The precise form of the cut-off and the energy

where it is applied will be left unspecified. Of course, the cut-off

spoils the relativistic invariance of the theory. This is a blemish
which cannot be avoided in our present state of ignorance of high-
energy processes.

Even with a cut-off the no-particle state Q is not approximately
stationary. It therefore differs very much from the vacuum state.
The vacuum state must contain many particles, which may be
pictured as in a state of transient existence with violent fluctua-
tions.

Let us introduce the ket |V> to represent the vacuum state. It is
the eigenket of H* belonging to the lowest eigenvalue. Here and sub-
sequently H* denotes the expression (114) modified by the cut-off.
One might try to calculate |V> as a perturbation of the ket |Q), but
such a method would be of doubtful validity, because the difference
between |V> and |Q> is not small. No satisfactory way of calculating
|V> is known. In any case the result would depend strongly on the
cut-off, and since the cut-off is unspecified the result would not be a
definite one. .

It follows that we must develop the theory without knowing [V).
This is not a great hardship, because we are not mainly interested in
the vacuum state. We are mainly interested in states which differ
from the vacuum through having a few particles present in addition
to those associated with the vacuum fluctuations, and we want to
know how these extra particles behave. For this purpose we focus our
attention on an operator K representing the creation of the extra
particles, so that the state we are interested in appears as KiV).

We do not know how the ket |V> varies with the time in the Schré-
dinger picture, since we do not know the lowest eigenvalue of H*. To
﻿§ 81 DIFFICULTIES OF THE THEORY 309

avoid this difficulty we work in the Heisenberg picture in which |V> is
constant. We then require K|V> to represent another state in the
Heisenberg picture and thus to be another constant ket. This leads to

dK |dt = 0. (120)

Usually K will involve the time explicitly as well as Heisenberg
dynamical variables, so (120) gives

ihoK |ot-+-KH*—H*K = 0. (121)

We now have each physical state determined by a solution K of
(120) or (121). We obtained this result without knowing the vacuum
ket |V>, and we can proceed to study K without knowing |V)>. The
only further information about K that we would have if we did know
|V> would be that two K’s, say K, and K,, would correspond to the
same state if we had (K,—K,)|V> = 0. But we can get on without
this further information and count all different K’s satisfying (121)
as corresponding to different states.

We are thus led to a drastic alteration of one of the basic ideas of
quantum mechanics, namely to represent a state by a linear operator and
not a ket vector. This alteration is brought about by the complexities
of applying quantum mechanics to a field and by our ignorance of
high-energy processes.

A trivial solution of (120) or (121) is K = 1. This evidently corre-
sponds to the vacuum state.

A general solution may be put in the form of an explicit function of
t and of the dynamical variables at time t. Let us use the symbol 7.
to denote collectively the emission operators at time #. Thus 7
equals one of the variables 7,,, ip, lap at the time ¢ in the Heisenberg
picture. The absorption operators are then 7,. A solution of (121) then

“ppeses K = f (tempi). (122)
We require some physical interpretation for the state represented by
this K, as the usual physical interpretation of quantum mechanics,
requiring a state to be represented by a ket, is no longer applicable.

We shall need to make some new assumptions.
Keeping to the Heisenberg picture, we introduce at each time t the

ket |Q,> satisfying the conditions (116) with respect to the Heisenberg
dynamical variables at time ¢. These conditions may now be written

MQ = 0.

The ket |Q,> corresponds to no particles existing at the time ¢ and it
provides a reference ket for the discussion of general states at time t.
﻿310 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS § 81

For any state fixed by a solution K of (121) we form K|Q> and
assume that this ket determines what can be observed at the time t and is
to be interpreted according to the standard rules. We obtain K in the
form (122) and then arrange it so that in each term all the absorption
operators 7, are to the right of all the emission operators 7. It is then
said to be in the normal order. Any term in K containing an absorption
operator then contributes nothing to K|Q,5. The surviving terms in
K|Q,p will contain only emission operators, like (117). Each surviving
term is associated with certain particles in particular states, and the
square of the modulus of its coefficient (with the appropriate factors
n! when there is more than one boson in the same state) is assumed to
be, after normalization, the probability of these particles existing in
these particular states at the time ¢.

We now have a general method of physical interpretation which is
rather similar to the usual one, but there are important differences.
A term in &K with an absorption operator on the right will not con-
tribute to K|Q,> and so will not contribute anything observable at
time ¢. We may call it a latent term at the time?. Such a term cannot
be discarded as non-existent, because it will contribute observable
effects at other times. These latent terms are a new feature of the
theory and are to be understood as an incompleteness in the descrip-
tion of a state in terms merely of the particles which can be observed.
to be present at a certain time.

As a consequence of the occurrence of latent terms, if K|Q,> is
normalized at one time, it will usually not be normalized at other times.
We thus have to carry out a separate normalization for each time in
order to derive the probabilities.

82. Applications

There are two important applications of the foregoing theory in
which effects are calculated that cannot be obtained from a more
primitive theory. These applications are concerned with a single
electron in a static electric or magnetic field. As a consequence of the
interaction of the electron with electromagnetic waves, the energy
levels are shifted somewhat from their values given by the elementary
theory. The important cases are:

(i) An electron in the Coulomb field of a proton. The theory here
leads to a shift in the energy levels of the hydrogen atom, It is
named the Lamb shift, after its discoverer.

(ii) An electron in a uniform magnetic field. The extra energy is
﻿APPLIGATIONS 311

here interpreted as arising from an extra magnetic moment of
the electron, called the anomalous magnetic moment.

. To take a static field into account one mercly has to introduce
potentials to describe it and add them on to the potentials in the
Hamiltonian. The potentials of the static field are functions of
%4, Xa, %, only, and are numbers for each x,, %, %, not dynamical
variables, so their introduction does not increase the number of degrees
of freedom.

The calculations of the Lamb shift and anomalous magnetic moment
are rather complicated. They are given in detail, working from the
Hamiltonian H, in the author’s book Lectures on Quantum Field
Theory (Academic Press, 1966). The results are in good agreement with
experiment and provide a confirmation of the theory.

These calculations were made in terms of the Heisenberg picture
throughout. One may tackle quantum electrodynamics on the
Schrédinger picture, looking for a solution of the Schrodinger equation
by taking the no-particle ket, or a ket corresponding to just a few
particles present, as the initial ket of a perturbation procedure and
applying the standard perturbation technique. One finds that the
later terms are large and depend strongly on the cut-off, or are
infinite if there is no cut-off. The perturbation procedure is not
logically valid under these conditions.

Nevertheless people have developed this method a long way and
have devised werking rules for discarding infinities (in a theory
without cut-off) in a systematic manner, so that finite residual effects
remain. The procedure is described in many books, e.g. Heitler’s
Quantum. Theory of Radiation (Clarendon Press, 1954). The original
calculations of the Lamb shift and anomalous magnetic moment were
carried out on these lines, long before the corresponding calculations
in the Heisenberg picture. The results are the same by both methods.

I do not see how these calculations based on the Schrédinger
picture, supplemented by some working rules, can be presented as a
logical development of the standard principles of quantum mechanics.
The Schrédinger picture is unsuited for dealing with quantum electro-
dynamics, because the vacuum fluctuations play such a dominant role
in it. These fluctuations present great mathematical difficulties, and
also they are not of physical importance. They get bypassed when one
uses the Heisenberg picture, and one is then able to concentrate on
quantities that are of physical importance.
