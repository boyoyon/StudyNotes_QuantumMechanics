<h2>42. General remarks</h2>
<p>
In the preceding chapter exact treatments were given of some simple
dynamical systems in the quantum theory. Most quantum problems,
however, cannot be solved exactly with the present resources of
mathematics, as they lead to equations whose solutions cannot be
expressed in finite terms with the help of the ordinary functions of
analysis. For such problems one can often use a perturbation method.
This consists in splitting up the Hamiltonian into two parts, one of
which must be simple and the other small. The first part may then
be considered as the Hamiltonian of a simplified or unperturbed
system, which can be dealt with exactly, and the addition of the
second will then require small corrections, of the nature of a perturba-
tion, in the solution for the unperturbed system. The requirement
that the first part shall be simple requires in practice that it shall not
involve the time explicitly. If the second part contains a small
numerical factor e, we can obtain the solution of our equations for
the perturbed system in the form of a power series in e, which, pro-
vided it converges, will give the answer to our problem with any
desired accuracy. Even when the series does not converge, the first
approximation obtained by means of it is usually fairly accurate.
There are two distinct methods in perturbation theory. In one of
these the perturbation is considered as causing @ modification of the
states of motion of the unperturbed system. In the other we do not
consider any modification to be made in the states of the unperturbed
system, but we suppose that the perturbed system, instead of remain-
ing permanently in one of these states, is continually changing from
one to another, or making transitions, under the influence of the
perturbation. Which method is to be used in any particular case
depends on the nature of the problem to be solved. The first method
is useful usually only when the perturbing energy (the correction in the
Hamiltonian for the undisturbed system) does not involve the time
explicitly, and is then applied to the stationary states. It can be used
for calculating things that do not refer to any definite time, such as
the energy-levels of the stationary, states of the perturbed system, or,
in the case of collision problems, the probability of scattering through
﻿168 PERTURBATION THEORY § 42

a given angle. The second method must, on the other hand, be used
for solving all problems involving a consideration of time, such as
those about the transient phenomena that occur when the perturba-
tion is suddenly applied, or more generally problems in which the
perturbation varies with the time in any way (i.e. in which the per-
turbing energy involves the time explicitly). Again, this second
method must be used in collision problems, even though the per-
turbing energy does not here involve the time explicitly, if one
wishes to calculate absorption and emission probabilities, since these
probabilities, unlike a scattering probability, cannot be defined with-
out reference to a state of affairs that varies with the time.

One can summarize the distinctive features of the two methods by
saying that, with the first method, one compares the stationary states
of the perturbed system with those of the unperturbed system; with
the second method one takes a stationary state of the unperturbed

system and sees how it varies with time under the influence of the
perturbation.

43. The change in the energy -levels caused by a perturbation

The first of the above-mentioned methods will now be applied to
the calculation of the changes in the energy-levels of a system caused
by a perturbation. We assume the perturbing energy, like the Hamil-
tonian for the unperturbed system, not to involve the time explicitly.
Our problem has a meaning, of course, only provided the energy-levels
of the unperturbed system are discrete and the differences between
them are large compared with the changes in them caused by the
perturbation. This circumstance results in the treatment of perturba-
tion problems by the first method having some different features

according to whether the energy-levels of the unperturbed system are
discrete or continuous.

Let the Hamiltonian of the perturbed system be

H=E-+Y, (1)
H being the Hamiltonian of the unperturbed system and V the small
perturbing energy. By hypothesis each eigenvalue H’ of H lies very
close to one and only one eigenvalue H’ of H. We shall use the same
number of primes to specify any eigenvalue of H and the eigenvalue
of E to which it lies very close. Thus we shall have H” differing from
E" by a small quantity of order V and differing from H’ by a quantity
that is not small unless H’ = H”. We must now take care always to
﻿§ 43 CHANGE IN THE ENERGY-LEVELS 169

use different numbers of primes to specify eigenvalues of H and &

which we do not want to lie very close together.
To obtain the eigenvalues of H, we have to solve the equation

H\H'> = H’|H’>
or (H'—H)|H> = VIA’). (2)
Let |0) be an eigenket of E belonging to the eigenvalue H’ and
suppose the |H’) and H’ that satisfy (2) to differ from |0> and LZ’
only by small quantities and to be expressed as
|H'> = |0)+[1>+ 129+... 6)
A! = E'+a,+a_+...,
where |1) and a, are of the first order of smallness (i.e. the same order

as V), |2> and a, are of the second order, and so on. Substituting
these expressions in (2), we obtain

{B'—EB+a,y+a,+..}{|0>+|I+|2+..} = V{JO>+/D+...}.
If we now separate the terms of zero order, of the first order, of the
second order, and so on, we get the following set of equations,

(E'— £)|0> = 0,
(E’ — E)\1>+4,/0> = V{0>, (4)
(£' — B)|2)+a,|1>+a,/0> = VI),

The first of these equations tells us, what we have already assumed, ~
that |0) is an eigenket of # belonging to the eigenvalue £’. The others
enable us to calculate the various corrections {1}, |2),..., @y,@g-0-
For the further discussion of these equations it is convenient to
. introduce a representation in which FH is diagonal, ie. a Heisenberg
representation for the unperturbed system, and to take Z itself as
one of the observables whose eigenvalues label the representatives.
Let the others, in the event of others being necessary, as is the case
when there is more than one eigenstate of H belonging to any eigen-
value, be called §’s. A basic bra is then <#"B"|. Since |0> is an
eigenket of H belonging to the eigenvalue E’, we have

(ENB) = Berar f(P"), (5)
where f(8”) is some function of the variables 8”. With the help of this
result the second of equations (4), written in terms of representatives,

becomes

(B’— B’)E"B" 1) +0, bre f(B") = 2 (B"B"|V EPR HB). (8)
﻿170 PERTURBATION THEORY § 43
Putting H” = H' here, we get
a,f(8") = 2 (EVR V | E'B') f(B'). (7)

Equation (7) is of the form of the standard equation in the theory
of eigenvalues, so far as the variables f’ are concerned. It shows that
the various possible values for a, are the eigenvalues of the matrix
<E'p"|V{E’p’>. This matrix is a part of the representative of the
perturbing energy in the Heisenberg representation for the unper-
turbed system, namely, the part consisting of those elements that
refer to the same unperturbed energy-level #’ for their row and
column. Each of these values for a, gives, to the first order, an energy-
level of the perturbed system lying close to the energy-level E’ of the
unperturbed system.} There may thus be several energy-levels of the
perturbed system lying close to the one energy-level #’ of the unper-
turbed system, their number being anything not exceeding the
number of independent states of the unperturbed system belonging
to the energy-level E’. In this way the perturbation may cause a
separation or partial separation of the energy-levels that coincide
at E’ for the unperturbed system.

Equation (7) also determines, to the zero order, the representatives
<E’B"\0> of the stationary states of the perturbed system belonging
to energy-levels lying close to £’, any solution f(6’) of (7) substituted
in (5) giving one such representative. Each of these stationary states
of the perturbed system approximates to one of the stationary states
of the unperturbed system, but the converse, that each stationary
state of the unperturbed system approximates to one of the stationary
states of the perturbed system, is not true, since the general
stationary state of the unperturbed system belonging to the energy-
level HE’ is represented by the right-hand side of (5) with an arbitrary
function f(8”). The problem of finding which stationary states of
the unperturbed system approximate to stationary states of the
perturbed system, i.e. the problem of finding the solutions f(8') of
(7), corresponds to the problem of ‘secular perturbations’ in classical
mechanics. It should be noted that the above results are indepen-
dent of the values of all those matrix elements of the perturbing

+ To distinguish these energy-levels one from another we should require some
more elaborate notation, since according to the present notation they must all be
specified by the same number of primes, namely by the number of primes specifying

the energy-level of the unperturbed system from which they arise. For our present
purposes, however, this more elaborate notation is not required.
﻿§ 43 CHANGE IN THE ENERGY-LEVELS _ 171

energy which refer to two different energy-levels of the unperturbed
system.

Let us see what the above results become in the specially simple case
when there is only one stationary state of the unperturbed system
belonging to each energy-level.t In this case # alone fixes the repre-
sentation, no f’s being required. The sum in (7) now reduces to a
single term and we get

ay = (EVE. (8)
There is only one energy-level of the perturbed system lying close to
any energy-level of the unperturbed system and the change wn energy
ts equal, in the first order, to the corresponding diagonal element of the
perturbing energy in the Heisenberg representation for the unperturbed

system, or to the average value of the perturbing energy for the correspond-
ing unperturbed state. The latter formulation of the result is the same
as in classical mechanics when the unperturbed system is multiply
periodic.

We shall proceed to calculate the second-order correction a, in
the energy-level for the case when the unperturbed system is non-
degenerate. Equation (5) for this case reads

(B'\0) = dex;
with neglect of an unimportant numerical factor, and equation (6)
This gives us the value of (#”|1> when £” + H’, namely

The third of equations (4), written in terms of representatives,

44, The perturbation considered as causing transitions

We shall now consider the second of the two perturbation methods
mentioned in § 42. We suppose again that we have an unperturbed
system governed by a Hamiltonian H which does not involve the
time explicitly, and a perturbing energy V which can now be an
arbitrary function of the time. The Hamiltonian for the perturbed
system is again H = H-+V. For the present method it does not
make any essential difference whether the energy-levels of the
unperturbed system, i.e. the eigenvalues of H, form a discrete or
continuous set. We shall, however, take the discrete case, for
definiteness. We shall again work with a Heisenberg representation
for the unperturbed system, but as there will now be no advantage in
taking E itself as one of the observables whose eigenvalues label the
representatives, we shall suppose we have a general set of «’s to label

the representatives.

Let us suppose that at the initial time é) the system is in a state for
which the «’s certainly have the values «’. The ket corresponding to
this state is the basic ket |«’>. If there were no perturbation, i.e. if the
Hamiltonian were E, this state would be stationary.. The perturba-
tion causes the state to change. At time the ket corresponding to the
state in Schrédinger’s picture will be T'lo’>, according to equation (1)
of § 27. The probability of the «’s then having the values «” is

P(o'n”) = [<a |Pa’>|*. (11)

For «” ~«’, P(a’«’) is the probability of a transition taking place
from state «' to state «” during the time interval f) > t, while P(a’a’)

+ Z.f. Physik, 35 (1925), 568.
﻿§ 44 PERTURBATION CAUSING TRANSITIONS 173

is the probability of no transition taking place at all. The sum of
P(a'x”) for all x” is, of course, unity.

Let us now suppose that initially the system, instead of being
certainly in the state «’, is in one or other of various states o’ with
the probability P,, for each. The Gibbs density corresponding to this

distribution is, according to (68) of § 33
p= > |a’>P <a’. (12)

At time ¢, each ket |«’> will have changed to T'|a’> and each bra <a’ |
to <x’|F, so p will have changed to

pp = Dla" yP,Xal |P. (13)

The probability of the «’s then having the values «” will be, from
(73) of § 33, <a” |p;|ex"> — > ot” | Ta! Py Cal |Tha">

= 5 Py Plo'a’) (14)

with the help of (11). This result expresses that the probability of
the system being in the state «” at time ¢ is the sum of the probabilities
of the system being initially in any state «’ ~ «", and making a transi-
tion from state «’ to state «” and the probability of its being initially
in the state w” and making no transition. Thus the various transition
probabilities act independently of one another, according to the
ordinary laws of probability.

The whole problem of calculating transitions thus reduces to the
determination of the probability amplitudes <«"|7’|w’>. These can be
worked out from the differential equation for 7’, equation (6) of § 27, or

dT dt = HT = (E+V)1T. (15)

The calculation can be simplified by working with
P% ao gi El-tMn TZ, (16)

We have dT */dt = et tolk(— ET +1 dT /dt)
= CAM DT — VT, (17)
where VE = eth th Ve -tEt yh, (18)

ie. V* is the result of applying a certain unitary transformation to V.
Equation (17) is of a more convenient form than (15), because (17)
makes the change in 7* depend entirely on the perturbation V, and
﻿174 PERTURBATION THEORY § 44

for V = 0 it would make 7'* equal its initial value, namely unity.
We have from (16)

Kal | PA |a) = et U-t0IN "| la’,

so that P(a'e”) = |<o"|T*|x’>[2, (19)
showing that 7'* and 7 are equally good for determining transition
probabilities.

Our work up to the present has been exact. We now assume V is
a small quantity of the first order and express 7'* in the form

T* = ATF TEH..., (20)

where T* is of the first order, Tf is of the second, and so on. Substi-
tuting (20) into (17) and equating terms of equal order, we get

ihdT* [dt = V*,
id TE [dt = V*T*, (21)

From the first of these equations we obtain
t
T# = ih} ii V(t!) dt’, (22)

from the second we obtain
t tv

and so on. For many practical problems it is sufficiently accurate to
retain only the term 7*, which gives for the transition probability

We obtain in this way the transition probability to the second order
of accuracy. The result depends only on the matrix element
<a" |V*(t’)|x’> of V*(t') referring to the two states concerned, with ¢’
going from é, to ¢. Since V* is real, like V,

to the second order of accuracy.

Sometimes one is interested in a transition «’ > «” such that the
matrix element <«"|V*|a’> vanishes, or is small compared with other
matrix elements of V*. It is then necessary to work to a higher
accuracy. If we retain only the terms 7} and T#, we get, for x” 4 a’,

‘The terms a” == o’ and a” = «” are omitted from the sum since they
are small compared with other terms of the sum, on account of the
smallness of <x"|V*{a'>. To interpret the result (26), we may suppose
that the term t

gives rise to a transition directly from state «’ to state «”, while the

to i,
gives rise to a transition from state «’ to state «”, followed by a
transition from state «” to state «”. The state «” is called an inter-
mediate state in this interpretation. We must add the term (27) to the
various terms (28) corresponding to different intermediate states
and then take the square of the modulus of the sum, which means
that there is interference between the different transition processes—
the direct one and those involving intermediate states—and one can-
not give a meaning to the probability for one of these processes by
itself. For each of these processes, however, there is a probability
amplitude. If one carries out the perturbation method to a higher
degree of accuracy, one obtains a result which can be interpreted
similarly, with the help of more complicated transition processes
involving a succession of intermediate states.

45. Application to radiation

In the preceding section a general theory of the perturbation of an
atomic system was developed, in which the perturbing energy could
vary with the time in an arbitrary way. A perturbation of this
kind can be realized in practice by allowing incident electromagnetic
﻿176 PERTURBATION THEORY § 45

radiation to fall on the system. Let us see what our result (24) reduces
to in this case.

If we neglect the effects of the magnetic field of the incident radia-
tion, and if we further assume that the wave-lengths of the harmonic
components of this radiation are all large compared with the dimen-
sions of the atomic system, then the perturbing energy is simply the

scalar product V = (D, 8), (29)

where D is the total electric displacement of the system and € is
the electric force of the incident radiation. We suppose € to be a
given function of the time. If we take for simplicity the case when
the incident radiation is plane polarized with its electric vector in
a certain direction and let D denote the Cartesian component of D
in this direction, the expression (29) for V reduces to the ordinary

product V=Dé,

where & is the magnitude of the vector &. The matrix elements of
V are <a" |V fo!» = <x" |D|a’"d€,

since € is a number. The matrix element <«”|D|a’> is independent
of t From (18)

and hence the expression (24) for the transition probability becomes

If the incident radiation during the time interval f, to ¢ is resolved
into its Fourier components, the energy crossing unit area per unit

Comparing this with (30), we obtain
P(a'a") = 2acMh-*| <a" |_D lo’ PH, (32)
where vse |M"—E'|[h. (33)

From this result we see in the first place that the transition proba-
bility depends only on that Fourier component of the incident radia-
tion whose frequency v is connected with the change of energy by (33).
﻿§ 45 APPLICATION TO RADIATION 177

This gives us Bohr’s Frequency Condition and shows how the ideas
of Bohr’s atomic theory, which was the forerunner of quantum
mechanics, can be fitted in with quantum mechanics.

The present elementary theory does not tell us anything about the
energy of the field of radiation. It would be reasonable to assume,
though, that the energy absorbed or liberated by the atomic system
in the transition process comes from or goes into the component of
the radiation with frequency v given by (33). This assumption will
be justified by the more complete theory of radiation given in
Chapter X. The result (32) is then to be interpreted as the proba-
bility of the system, if initially in the state of lower energy, absorb-
ing radiation and being carried to the upper state, and if initially in
the upper state, being stimulated by the incident radiation to emit
and fall to the lower state. The present theory does not account for
the experimental fact that the system, if in the upper state with no
incident radiation, can emit spontaneously and fall to the lower state,
but this also will be accounted for by the more complete theory of
Chapter X.

The existence of the phenomenon of stimulated emission was in-
ferred by Einstein,} long before the discovery of quantum mechanics,
from a consideration of statistical equilibrium between atoms and a
field of black-body radiation satisfying Planck’s law. Hinstein showed
that the transition probability for stimulated emission must equal
that for absorption between the same pair of states, in agreement
with the present quantum theory, and deduced also a relation con-
necting this transition probability with that for spontaneous emission,
which relation is in agreement with the theory of Chapter X.

The matrix element <«"|D|a«’> in (32) plays the part of the ampli-
tude of one of the Fourier components of D in the classical theory of
a multiply-periodic system interacting with radiation. In fact it was
the idea of replacing classical Fourier components by matrix elements
which led Heisenberg to the discovery of quantum mechanics in 1925.
Heisenberg assumed that the formulas describing the interaction with
radiation of a system in the quantum theory can be obtained from
the classical formulas by substituting for the Fourier components of
the total electric displacement of the system the corresponding matrix
elements. According to this assumption applied to spontaneous emis-
sion, a system having an electric moment D will, when in the state

﻿178 PERTURBATION THEORY § 15

a’, spontaneously emit radiation of frequency v = (#’—E")/h, where
EB" is an energy-level, less than E’, of some state «”, at the rate

4 (2av)*

3 8
The distribution of this radiation over the different directions of
emission and its state of polarization for each direction will be the
same as that for a classical electric dipole of moment equal to the
real part of <a”|D|«’>. To interpret this rate of emission of radiant
energy as a transition probability, we must divide it by the quantum
of energy of this frequency, namely hy, and call it the probability per

atomic system simultaneously dropping to the state a” of lower
energy. These assumptions of Heisenberg are justified by the present
radiation theory, supplemented by the spontaneous transition theory

of Chapter X.

46. Transitions caused by a perturbation independent of the
time

The perturbation method of § 44 is still valid when the perturbing
energy V does not involve the time f explicitly. Since the total
Hamiltonian H in this case does not involve ¢ explicitly, we could
now, if desired, deal with the system by the perturbation method of
§ 43 and find its stationary states. Whether this method would be
convenient or not would depend on what we want to find out about
the system. If what we have to calculate makes an explicit reference
to the time, e.g. if we have to calculate the probability of the system
being in a certain state at one time when we are given that it is in a
certain state at another time, the method of § 44 would be the more

convenient one.
Let us see what the result (24) for the transition probab’' lity becomes

when V does not involve t explicitly and let us take ty = 0 to simplify
the writing. The matrix element <«”|V|«’> is now independent of t,

﻿§ 46 TRANSITION PROBABILITIES 179

If #” differs appreciably from #’ this transition probability is small
and remains so for all values of t. This result is required by the law
of the conservation of energy. The total energy H is constant and
hence the proper-energy # (i.e. the energy with neglect of the part
V due to the perturbation), being approximately equal to H, must
be approximately constant. This means that if # initially has the
numerical value #’, at any later time there must be only a small
probability of its having a numerical value differing considerably
from £’.

On the other hand, when the initial state a’ is such that there exists
another state a” having the same or very nearly the same proper-
energy J, the probability of a transition to the final state «” may be
quite large. The case of physical interest now is that in which there
is a continuous range of final states «” having a continuous range of
proper-energy levels H” passing through the value ’ of the proper-
energy of the initial state. The initial state must not be one of the
continuous range of final states, but may be either a separate discrete
state or one of another continuous range of states. We shall now have,
remembering the rules of § 18 for the interpretation of probability
amplitudes with continuous ranges of states, that, with P(w‘x”)
having the value (36), the probability of a transition to a final state
within the small range «” to «”-+da” will be P(a’ax”) dx” if the initial
state a’ is discrete and will be proportional to this quantity if a’ is
one of a continuous range.

We may suppose that the o’s describing the final state consist of
# together with a number of other dynamical variables 8, so that we
have a representation like that of § 43 for the degenerate case. (The
f’s, however, need have no meaning for the initial state «’.) We shall
suppose for definiteness that the §’s have only discrete eigenvalues.
The total probability of a transition to a final state «” for which the
B’s have the values B” and # has any value (there will be a strong
probability of its having a value near the initial value ZH’) will now
be (or be proportional to)

Thus the total probability up to time ¢ of a transition to a final state
for which the f’s have the values fp” is proportional to ¢. There is

therefore a definite probability coefficient, or probability per unit time,
for the transition process under consideration, having the value

Qrh-* | B'B"|V Joe") |?. (39)

It is proportional to the square of the modulus of the matrix element,
associated with this transition, of the perturbing energy.
If the matrix element <E’B"|V|x’> is small compared with other

matrix elements of Y, we must work with the more accurate formula
(26). We have from (35)

In order that the approximations used in deriving (39) and (40) may
be valid, the time ¢ must be not too small and not too large. It must
be large compared with the periods of the atomic system in order that
the approximate evaluation of the integral (37) leading to the result
(38) may be valid, while it must not be excessively large or else the
general formula (24) or (26) will break down. In fact one could make
the probability (38) greater than unity by taking ¢ large enough. The
upper limit to tis fixed by the condition that the probability (24) or
(26), or é times (39) or (40), must be small compared with unity. There
is no difficulty in ¢ satisfying both these conditions simultaneously
provided the perturbing energy V is sufficiently small.

47. The anomalous Zeeman effect

One of the simplest examples of the perturbation method of § 43
is the calculation of the first-order change in the energy-levels of an
atom caused by a uniform magnetic field. The problem of a hydrogen
atom in a uniform magnetic field has already been dealt with in § 41
and was so simple that perturbation theory was unnecessary. The
case of a general atom is not much more complicated when we make
a few approximations such that we can set up a simple model for the
atom.

We first of all consider the atom in the absence of the magnetic
field and look for constants of the motion or quantities that are
approximately constants of the motion. The total angular momen-
tum of the atom, the vector j say, is certainly a constant of the
motion. This angular momentum may be regarded as the sum of two
parts, the total orbital angular momentum of all the electrons, | say,
and the total spin angular momentum, s say. Thus we have j =I-+s.
Now the effect of the spin magnetic moments on the motion of the
electrons is small compared with the effect of the Coulomb forces and
may be neglected as a first approximation. With this approximation
the spin angular momentum of each electron is a constant of the
motion, there being no forces tending to change its orientation. Thus
s, and hence also 1, will be constants of the motion. The magnitudes,
1, s, and j say, of I, s, and j will be given by

I+Hi = (B+R+E+20),
s+ = (BSB ot + dH),
i+ = GI),

$595.57 N
﻿182 PERTURBATION THEORY § 47

corresponding to equation (39) of § 36. They commute with each
other, and from (47) of § 36 we see that with given numerical values
for L and s the possible numerical values for 7 are

l+s, l+s—f, ..., |l—s|.

Let us consider a stationary state for which J, s, and j have definite
numerical values in agreement with the above scheme. The energy
of this state will depend on /, but one might think that with neglect
of the spin magnetic moments it would be independent of s, and
also of the direction of the vector s relative to J, and thus of 7. It will
be found in Chapter IX, however, that the energy depends very much
on the magnitude s of the vector s, although independent of its
direction when one neglects the spin magnetic moments, on account
of certain phenomena arising from the fact that the electrons are
indistinguishable one from another. There are thus different energy-
levels of the system for each different value of / and s. This means
that | and s are functions of the energy, according to the general
definition of a function given in § 11, since the / and s of a stationary
state are fixed when the energy of that state is fixed.

We can now take into account the effect of the spin magnetic
moments, treating it as a small perturbation according to the method
of § 43. The energy of the unperturbed system will still be approxi-
mately a constant of the motion and hence / and s, being functions
of this energy, will still be approximately constants of the motion.
The directions of the vectors 1 and s, however, not being functions of
the unperturbed energy, need not now be approximately constants
of the motion and may undergo large secular variations. Since the
vector j is constant, the only possible variation of | and s is a pre-
cession about the vector j. We thus have an approximate model of
the atom consisting of the two vectors | and s of constant lengths
precessing about their sum j, which is a fixed vector. The energy is
determined mainly by the magnitudes of 1 and s and depends only
slightly on their relative directions, specified by j. Thus states with
the same / and s and different j will have only slightly different
energy-levels, forming what is called a multiplet term.

Let us now take this atomic model as our unperturbed system and
suppose it to be subjected to a uniform magnetic field of magnitude #
in the direction of the z-axis. The extra energy due to this magnetic
field will consist of a term

eF#/2me.(m,+ hio,), (41)
﻿§ 47 THE ANOMALOUS ZEEMAN EFFECT 183

like the last term in equation (89) of § 41, contributed by each
electron, and will thus be altogether

eH /2me. > (m,--ha,) = eF#/2mc.(l,-+-28,) = e#/2me.(9,+-8,). (42)
This is our perturbing energy VY. We shall now use the method of
§ 43 to determine the changes in the energy-levels caused by this V.
The method will be legitimate only provided the field is so weak that
V is small compared with the energy differences within a multiplet.

Our unperturbed system is degenerate, on account of the direction
of the vector j being undetermined. We must therefore take, from
the representative of V in a Heisenberg representation for the un-
perturbed system, those matrix elements that refer to one particular
energy-level for their row and column, and obtain the eigenvalues of
the matrix thus formed. We can do this best by first splitting up V
into two parts, one of which is a constant of the unperturbed motion,
so that its representative contains only matrix elements referring to
the same unperturbed energy-level for their row and column, while
the representative of the other contains only matrix elements refer-
ring to two different unperturbed energy-levels for their row and
column, so that this second part does not affect the first-order per-
turbation. The term involving j, in (42) is a constant of the un-
perturbed motion and thus belongs entirely to the first part. For the
term involving s, we have

SAPE+IEAD) = JASrJz SyJy S2Jz) 1 (825 D282) Ix (S2Jy Ja Sy)dy
or

= Ie ij tn) —Ul-+h) +9(5-+8)]—Lyyhe—Yelu 3
Sz Gan )—Ul+-h)+8(s+h)]—[yyJu Yeu oem (43)

where
Vn = S:dy—Je8y = Szly—L sy = ly s,—l, sy,

| as

= IS Sidq = L, 85 Syl, = 1, 8,—~l, 8.

The first term ‘in this expression for s, is a constant of the unperturbed
motion land thus belongs entirely to the first part, while the second
term, as we shall now see, belongs entirely to the second part.

Corresponding to (44) we can introduce
Y_ == 1 8y—ly 8.
It can now easily be verified that

Ja Vatdy Vy tee =0
and from (30) of § 35

[jes x] = %Yy [yes Yu] = V2 [ie Ya = 0.
﻿184 PERTURBATION THEORY § 47

These relations connecting j,, j,,J, and y,, Yy, yz, are of the same form
as the relations connecting m,, m,, m, and x, y, z in the calculation
in § 40 of the selection rule for the matrix elements of z in a repre-
sentation with k diagonal. From the result there obtained that all
matrix elements of z vanish except those referring to two & values
differing by +/, we can infer that all matrix elements of y,, and
similarly of y, and y,, in a representation with j diagonal, vanish
except those referring to two j values differing by -#. The coeffi-
cients of y, and y, in the second term on the right-hand side of (43)
commute with j, so the representative of the whole of this term will
contain only matrix elements referring to two j values differing by
+4, and thus referring to two different energy-levels of the unper-
turbed system.

Hence the perturbing energy V becomes, when we neglect that
part of it whose representative consists of matrix elements referring
to two different unperturbed energy-levels,

et (5 JGR —UL+A) +5(8-+h)
Ime!*\ 2G-FR)
The eigenvalues of this give the first-order changes in the energy-
levels. We can make the representative of this expression diagonal
by choosing our representation such that j, is diagonal, and it then
gives us directly the first-order changes in the energy-levels caused by
the magnetic field. This expression is known as Landé’s formula.

The result (45) holds only provided the perturbing energy V is small
compared with the energy differences within a multiplet. For larger
values of V a more complicated theory is required. For very strong
fields, however, for which V is large compared with the energy differ-
ences within a multiplet, the theory is again very simple. We may
now neglect altogether the energy of the spin magnetic moments for
the atom with no external field, so that for our unperturbed system
the vectors | and s themselves are constants of the motion, and not
merely their magnitudes 7 and s. Our perturbing energy V, which is
still e#/2me.(j,+s,), is now a constant of the motion for the unper-
turbed system, so that its eigenvalues give directly the changes in the
energy-levels. These eigenvalues are integral or half-odd integral
multiples of eAh/2mc according to whether the number of electrons
in the atom is even or odd.
