<h2>59. An assembly of bosons</h2>
<p>
We consider a dynamical system composed of w’ similar particles.
We set up a representation for one of the particles with discrete basic
kets |a®>, |x, jo >,.... Then, as explained in § 54, we get a sym-
metrical representation of the assembly of w’ particles by taking as
basic kets the products

|a#> [a&> lag... lo> == lad of af...0%-> (1)
in which there is one factor for each particle, the suffixes 1, 2, 3,..., w’
of the a’s being the labels of the particles and the indices a, b, ¢,...,9
denoting indices , ®, ®,... in the basic kets for one particle. Tf the
particles are bosons, so that only symmetrical states occur in nature,
then we need to work with only the symmetrical kets that can be
constructed from the kets (1). The states corresponding to these
symmetrical kets will form a complete set of states for the assembly
of bosons. We can build up a theory of them as follows.

We introduce the linear operator S defined by

S=w!lt> P, (2)
the sum being taken over all the wu’! permutations of the w’ particles.
Then S applied to any ket for the assembly gives a symmetrical ket.
We may therefore call S the symmetrizing operator. From (8) of § 55
it is real. Applied to the ket (1) it gives

wl Plot of af...08,> == Sla%a%a®...a%>, (3)
the labels of the particles being omitted on the right-hand side as
they are no longer relevant. The ket (3) corresponds to a state for
the assembly of u’ bosons with a definite distribution of the bosons
among the various boson states, without any particular boson being
assigned to any particular state. The distribution of bosons is specl-
fied if we specify how many bosons are in each boson state. Let
Ni, Ny, 24,... be the numbers of bosons in the states a, of), of)...
respectively with this distribution. The n’’s are defined algebraically
by the equation

attabtott..f-ed = ny of? 4 Ny) } Ny oe (4)
The sum of the ns is of course u’. The number of n”s is equal to
the number of basic kets [a ), which in most applications of the
﻿226 THEORY OF RADIATION § 59

theory is very much greater than u’, so most of the n’’s will be zero.
If a, «®, of,..., a? are all different, i.e. if the n'’s are all 0 or 1, the
ket (3) is normalized, since in this case the terms on the left-hand
side of (3) are all orthogonal to one another and each contributes
u'!-1 to the squared length of the ket. However, if a4, 0, 0%)..., a7
are not all different, those terms on the left-hand side of (3) will
be equal which arise from permutations P which merely interchange
bosons in the same state. The number of equal terms will be
m,! ng! ng!..., so the squared length of the ket (3) will be
Cote? ol,..o9| 8? lataae...o% == ny! ng! ng!..- (5)
For dealing with a general state of the assembly we can introduce
the numbers ”,, M», %3,... of bosons in the states o, a, o®),..,
respectively and treat the n’s as dynamical variables or as observ-
ables. They have the eigenvalues 0, 1, 2,..., u’. The ket (3) is a
simultaneous eigenket of all the n’s, belonging to the eigenvalues
M4, Ny, Ng,.... The various kets (3) form a complete set for the
dynamical system consisting of u’ bosons, so the n’s all commute
(see the converse to the theorem of § 13). Further, there is only one
independent ket (3) belonging to any set of eigenvalues 7}, M9, %3,----
Hence the n’s form a complete set of commuting observables. If we
normalize the kets (3) and then label the -resulting kets by the
eigenvalues of the n’s to which they belong, ie. if we put

(m4! 25! 13!...) “FS fataba®...o8) = [ny ng ng...>, (6)
we get a set of kets |[n, ,73...>, with the n”s taking on all non-negative
integral values adding up to wu’, which kets will form the basic kets
of a representation with the n’s diagonal.

The n’s can be expressed as functions of the observables Oy, Og,

Q%g,.., &y Which define the basic kets of the individual bosons by
means of the equations

rg = >. 3a, ay? (7)
or the equations d a flo%) = ¥ f(a) (8)

holding for any function /.

Let us now suppose that the number of bosons in the assembly is
not given, but is variable. This number is then a dynamical variable
or observable u, with eigenvalues 0, 1, 2,..., and the ket (3) is an
eigenket of wu belonging to the eigenvalue u’. To get a complete
set of kets for our dynamical system we must now take all the
﻿§ 59 AN ASSEMBLY OF BOSONS 227

symmetrical kets (3) for all values of u’. We may arrange them in
order thus ty Jaty, Slata®y, Satara”), ..., (9)

where first is written the ket, with no label, corresponding to the
state with no bosons present, then come the kets corresponding to
states with one boson present, then those corresponding to states
with two bosons, and so on. A general state corresponds to a ket
which is a sum of the various kets (9). The kets (9) are all orthogonal
to one another, two kets referring to the same number of bosons being
orthogonal as before, and two referring to different numbers of bosons
being orthogonal since they are eigenkets of wu belonging to different
eigenvalues. By normalizing all the kets (9), we get a set of kets like
(6) with no restriction on the 7’s (i.e. each n’ taking on all non-
negative integral values) and these kets form the basic kets of a
representation with the n’s diagonal for the dynamical system con-
sisting of a variable number of bosons.

If there is no interaction between the bosons and if the basic kets
lo), |x®,... correspond to stationary states of a boson, the kets (9)
will correspond to stationary states for the assembly of bosons. The
number w of bosons is now constant in time, but it need not be a
specified number, i.e. the general state is a superposition of states
with various values for uw. If the energy of one boson is H(a), the
energy of the assembly will be

> (os) = 2 gH" (10)

from (8), H* being short for the number H(a*). This gives the
Hamiltonian for the assembly as a function of the dynamical
variables n.

60. The connexion between bosons and oscillators

In § 34 we studied the harmonic oscillator, a dynamical system of
one degree of freedom describable in terms of a canonical q and p,
such that the Hamiltonian is a sum of squares of g and p, with
numerical coefficients. We define a general oscillator mathematically
as a system of one degree of freedom describable in terms of a
canonical g and p, such that the Hamiltonian is a power series in ¥
and p, and remains so if the system is perturbed in any way. We
shall now study a dynamical system composed of several of these
oscillators. We can describe each oscillator in terms of, instead of
q and p, a complex dynamical variable 7, like the y of § 34, and its
﻿228 THEORY OF RADIATION § 60

conjugate complex 7, satisfying the commutation relation (7) of
§ 34. We attach labels 1, 2, 3,... to the different oscillators, so that
the whole set of oscillators is describable in terms of the dynamical

variables 41,° 2, Nase Fi Te a--- Satisfying the commutation
relations
Na oN Na = 9;
Nate Ta = 9, (11)
Fa Meo Ha = Sab-
Put Nata = Me (12)
so that Fate = Mtl. (13)

The n’s are observables which commute with one another and the
work of § 34 shows that each of them has as eigenvalues all non-
negative integers. For the ath oscillator there is a standard ket for
the Fock representation, |0,> say, which is a normalized eigenket of n,
belonging to the eigenvalue zero. By multiplying all these standard
kets together we get a standard ket for the Fock representation for
the set of oscillators, 10, }O,) 10) (14)

which is a simultaneous eigenket of all the n’s belonging to the
eigenvalues zero. We shall denote it simply by |0>. From (13) of §34

7jql0> = 0 (15)
for any a. The work of §34 also shows that, if m,, mg, ”5,... are any
non-negative integers, ott nt nB...|0> (16)

is a simultaneous eigenket of all the n’s belonging to the eigenvalues
Ny, Ng, My,... respectively. The various kets (16) obtained by taking
different n’’s form a complete set of kets all orthogonal to one another
and the square of the length of one of them is, from (16) of § 34,
n,!ng!ng!.... From this we see, bearing in mind the result (5), that
the kets (16) have just the same properties as the kets (9), so that
we can equate each ket (16) to the ket (9) referring to the same n’
values without getting any inconsistency. This involves putting

S focterPod’....0.7 = NaN Ter Iq|0>- (17)

The standard ket |0> becomes equal to the first of the kets (9), corre-
sponding to no bosons present.

The effect of equation (17) is to identify the states of an assembly
of bosons with the states of a set’ of oscillators. This means that the
﻿§60 CONNEXION BETWEEN BOSONS AND OSCILLATORS = 229

dynamical system consisting of an assembly of similar bosons 18 equiva-
lent to the dynamical system consisting of a set of oscillators—the two
systems are just the same system looked at from two different points of
view, There is one oscillator associated with each independent boson
state. We have here one of the most fundamental results of quantum
mechanics, which enables a unification of the wave and corpuscular
theories of light to be effected.

Our work in the preceding section was built up on a discrete set
of basic kets |x) for a boson. We could pass to a different discrete
set of basic kets, [84> say, and build up a similar theory on them.
The basic kets for the assembly would then be, instead of (9),

I>, IB4>, SIB4B™>, SIB4B3B°, .... (18)
The first of the kets (18), referring to no bosons present, is the same

as the first of the kets (9). Those kets (18) referring to one boson
present are linear functions of those kets (9) referring to one boson

present, namely iB = Ss joa? <a2/B45, (19)

and generally those kets (18) referring to «’ bosons present are linear
functions of those kets (9) referring to u’ bosons present. Associated
with the new basic states [84> for a boson there will be a new set
of oscillator variables 7,4, and corresponding to (17) we shall have

S|BAB¥BY...> = 1478 7-0). (20)
Thus a ket 147 ,...[0> with wu’ factors 44, 7,,... must be a linear func-
tion of kets 7, 7p...0> with w’ factors 7,, 7),.... It follows that each
linear operator 74 must be a linear function of the 7,’s. Equation

(19) gives 7.410> = ¥ tall><a" 84>
and hence na = > NXa|B>. (21)

Thus the 7’s transform according to the same law as the basic kets for
aboson. The transformed y’s satisfy, with their conjugate complexes,
the same commutation relations (11) as the original ones. The trans-
formed 7’s are on just the same footing as the original ones and hence,
when we look upon our dynamical system as a set of oscillators, the
different degrees of freedom have no invariant significance.

The 7s transform according to the same law as the basic bras for
a boson, and thus the same law as the numbers <a*|%> forming the

representative of a state x. This similarity people often describe by
359557
. Q
﻿230 THEORY OF RADIATION § 60

saying that the 7,’s are given by a process of second quantization
applied to <a*|x>, meaning thereby that, after one has set up a
quantum theory for a single particle and so introduced the numbers
<a#|x> representing a state of the particle, one can make these num-
bers into linear operators satisfying with their conjugate complexes
the correct commutation relations, like (11), and one then has the .
appropriate mathematical basis for dealing with an assembly of the
particles, provided they are bosons. There is a corresponding proce-
dure for fermions, which will be given in § 65.

Since an assembly of bosons is the same as a set of oscillators, it
must be possible to express any symmetrical function of the boson
variables in terms of the oscillator variables 7 and 7. An example
of this is provided by equation (10) with »,7, substituted for x,.
Let us see how it goes in general. Take first the case of a function
of the boson variables of the form

Up = & U, (22)

where each U. is a function only of the dynamical variables of the
rth boson, so that it has a representative <o“!U,|a2> referring to the
basic kets |a®> of the rth boson. In order that Up may be symmetrical,
this representative must be the same for all r, so that it can depend
only on the two eigenvalues labelled by a and b. We may therefore

waite 1 <aft|U,|ab> = <at|T aby = <a|T16) (28)
for brevity. We have
U jog off...) = S loft aifs..ot..)<a]U |,. (24)

a
Summing this equation for all values of r and applying the sym-

metrizing operator S to both sides, we get
SU plod off... == 2 3 S |o® of? .0%..><alO |x,>. (25)

Since U, is symmetrical we can replace SU, by U, S and can then
substitute for the symmetrical kets in (25) their values given by (17).
We get in this way

Up Nay Neos |0> = 2 2 Na "in Yar Mest |O><a| U |x,»
= 2a 2 ay Mas ee OP ra,K@1U >, (28)

<
na meaning that the factor 7, must be cancelled out. Now from

(15) and the commutation relations (11)
No Neer Qasr |0> = > "a Ne, Veer 10> 802, (27)
Tr
﻿§60 CONNEXION BETWEEN BOSONS AND OSCILLATORS — 231

(note that 7, is like the operator of partial differentiation 0/d7,), so
(26) becomes
Op Hey Ne|0> = 2 Na Tp Ney Ney |0><a| TO |b». (28)

The kets 7,, 7,,--.|0> form a complete set, and hence we can infer from
(28) the operator equation

O, = 2 nao] T [b> ip. (29)

'This gives us Up in terms of the 7 and 7 variables and the matrix
elements <a|U|b>.

Now Jet us take a symmetrical function of the boson variables
consisting of a sum of terms each referring to two bosons,

Vp = > Veg: (30)

We do not need to assume ¥, = V,. Corresponding to (23), V, has

matrix elements at ab|Trglagad> = <ab|V od> (31)

for brevity. Proceeding as before we get, corresponding to (25),
SVpoPoF...> = YY Slofta¥e..cf..08..><ab|V |x, x5> (32)

and corresponding to (26)
Vor Mee Max |0> = Na 2 1 Ne NaN |9P8on, San 640 |V led>. (33)

We can deduce as an extension of (27)

giving us the operator equation
Vo = >> Na 1o<ab|V |ed> A. Fa- (35)

‘The method can readily be extended to give any symmetrical func-
tion of the boson variables in terms of the y’s and 7’s.

The foregoing theory can easily be generalized to apply to an
assembly of bosons in interaction with some other dynamical system,
which we shall call for definiteness the atom. We must introduce a
set of basic kets, |£ say, for the atom alone. We can then get a set
of basic kets for the whole system of atom and bosons together by
multiplying each of the kets |£’> into each of the kets (9). We may
write these kets

iC, [C'a%, S[Lata®>, S[lata’a®>, o (36)
﻿232 THEORY OF RADIATION § 60

We may look upon the system as composed of the atom in interaction
with a set of oscillators, so that it can be described in terms of the
atom variables and the oscillator variables ,, 7,. Using again the
standard ket |0> for the set of oscillators, we have

Sl ata° a... = Na My Ne lOD[L>, (37)
corresponding to (17), as the equation expressing the basic kets
(36) in terms of the oscillator variables.

Any function of the atom variables and boson variables which is
symmetrical between all the bosons is expressible as a function of the
atom variables and the 7’s and 7’s. Consider first a function Up of
the form (22) with U. a function only of the atom variables and the
variables of the rth boson, so that it has a representative <£’o2|U,|C"02>.
This representative must be independent of r in order that Up may
be symmetrical between all the bosons, so we may write it

CC'at|O|6"aS. Now let us define <a|U|b> to be that function of the
atom variables whose representative is (C'a?|T7|C’«°>, so that we have

<CraplO| lary = Croat] T1o"ah> = <e'|CalU|b>10">, (38)
corresponding to (23). The equations (24)—(28) can now be taken over

and applied to the present work if both sides of all these equations

are multiplied by [¢’> on the right, with the result that formula (29)
still holds. We can deal similarly with a symmetrical function VY of
the form (30) with V, a function only of the atom variables and the
variables of the rth and sth bosons. Defining <ab|V|cd> to be that
function of the atom variables whose representative is

(Colt ab 08 08),
we find that formula (35) still holds.

61. Emission and absorption of bosons

Let us suppose that the oscillators of the preceding section are
harmonic oscillators and there is no interaction between them. The
energy of the ath oscillator is then, from (5) of § 34,

i, = hwy Na Fat tiw,.
We shall neglect the constant term }iw,, which is the energy of the
oscillator in its lowest state—the so-called ‘zero-point energy’. This
neglect does not have any dynamical consequences, as explained at

the beginning of § 30, and merely involves a redefinition of H,. The
total energy of ail the oscillators is now

Hy = > A, = > hwy a Na = > heog Na (39)
@ a a
﻿§ 61 EMISSION AND ABSORPTION OF BOSONS 233

with the help of (12). This is of the same form as (10), with hw, for
He, Thus a set of harmonic oscillators 1s equivalent to an assembly of
bosons in stationary states with no interaction between them. If an
oscillator of the set ts in tis n’th quantum state, there are n’ bosons in
the associated boson state.

In general the Hamiltonian for the set of oscillators will be a power
series in the variables 7,, 7,, Say

Hy = Hp+ 2 (OU, Na+ Datta) + > (Ue 1a +Vab Na Mot Van Fah) +--+
(40)
where Hp, U,, Ugy, Vy ave numbers, Hp being real and U,, = O,,. If
the set of oscillators are in interaction with an atom, as we had at
the end of the preceding section, the total Hamiltonian will still be
of the form (40), with Hp, U,, U,,, V,, functions of the atom variables,
Hy, in particular being the Hamiltonian for the atom by itself. A
general treatment of this dynamical system would be rather compli-
cated and for practical applications one assumes that the terms

Hp+ > Daa Nata (41)

are large compared with the others and form by themselves an
unperturbed system, the remaining terms being taken into account
as a perturbation producing transitions in the unperturbed system,
according to the theory of § 44. If, further, U,, is independent of the
atom variables, the unperturbed system with Hamiltonian (41) con-
sists merely of an atom with Hamiltonian Hp and an assembly of
bosons in stationary states with Hamiltonian of the form (39), with
no interaction.

Let us consider what kinds of transitions are produced by the
various perturbation terms in (40). Take a stationary state of the
unperturbed system for which the atom is in a stationary state, ¢’ say,

and bosons are present in the stationary boson states, a, 6, ¢,.... This
stationary state for the unperturbed system corresponds to the ket
Ta Mo Ner+!9>18°>, (42)

like (37). If the term U,», of (40) is multiplied into this ket, the
result is a linear combination of kets like :

Nae Qa Nd Nor |OS”, : , (43)

t” denoting any stationary state of the atom. The ket (43) refers to
one more boson than the ket (42), the extra boson being in the state x.
﻿234 THEORY OF RADIATION § 61

Thus the perturbation term U, 7, gives rise to transitions in which
one boson is emitted into state 2 and the atom makes an arbitrary
jump. If the term U, 4, of (40) is multiplied into (42), the result is
zero unless (42) contains a factor 7, and is then a linear combination

of Kets like Teta Mo te lO>1E">,

referring to one boson less in state xz. Thus the perturbation term
U,,9~ gives rise to transitions in which one boson is absorbed from
state x, the atom again making an arbitrary jump. Similarly, we find
that a perturbation term U,,, 7,7, ( 4 y) gives rise to processes in
which a boson is absorbed from state y and one is emitted into state
x, or, what is the same thing physically, one boson makes a transition
from state y to state x. This kind of process would be produced by
a term like the U, of (22) and (29) in the perturbation energy, pro-
vided the diagonal elements <a|U|a> vanish. Again, the perturbation
terms Vey "2 Ny» Vey Te Ty give rise to processes in which two bosons are
emitted or absorbed, and so on for more complicated terms. With
any of these emission and absorption processes the atom can make.
an arbitrary jump.

Let us determine how the probability of occurrence of each of these
. transition processes depends on the numbers of bosons originally
present in the various boson states. From §§ 44, 46 the transition
probability is always proportional to the square of the modulus of
the matrix element of the perturbation energy referring to the two
states concerned. Thus the probability of a boson being emitted into
state x with the atom making a jump from state ¢’ to state £” is
proportional to

1<"| <1 9--(Mip+ 1). [Uy Tel Mo--Mee->10">|?, (44)

the n”s being the numbers of bosons initially present in the various
boson states. Now from (6) and (17), with reference to (4),

,

[105 My Mg... > == (My! 5! 5...) — Pt a7! 4... 109, (45)

so that Ne |My Mg. Myee > = (1-1)? [24 N9..(n,+1)..>. (46)
Hence (44) is equal to

(m+ 1)/ CC U,12[?, (47)

showing that the probability of a transition in which a boson is emitted
into state x 1s proportional to the number of bosons originally in state x
plus one.
﻿§ 61 EMISSION AND ABSORPTION OF BOSONS © 235

The probability of a boson being absorbed from state x with the
atom making a jump from state ¢’ to state ¢” is proportional to

various boson states. Now from (45)

fol, Mya...) = n\n my.(m—1)..>, (49)

so (48) is equal to nJco" 0169/2. (50)

Thus the probability of a transition in which a boson is absorbed from
state x is proportional to the number of bosons originally in state x.

Similar methods may be applied to more complicated processes,

and show that the probability of a process in which a boson makes

a transition from state y to state x (x + y)is proportional to n,(n,+1).

More generally, the probability of a process in which bosons are
absorbed from states x, y,... and emitted into states a, b,... is propor-

tional to nn. (Miy A) (myth)... (51)
the n’’s being in each case the numbers of bosons originally present.
These results hold both for direct transition processes and transition

processes that take place through one or more intermediate states,
in accordance with the interpretation given at the end of § 44.

62. Application to photons

Since photons are bosons, the foregoing theory can be applied to
them. A photon is in a stationary state when it is in an eigenstate
of momentum. It then has two independent states of polarization,
which may be taken to be two perpendicular states of linear polariza-
tion. The dynamical variables needed to describe the stationary
states are then the momentum p, a vector, and a polarization variable
1, consisting of a unit vector perpendicular to p. The variables p and
1 take the place of our previous «’s. The eigenvalues of p consist of
all numbers from —co to co for each of the three Cartesian com-
ponents of p, while for each eigenvalue p’ of p, | has just two
eigenvalues, namely two arbitrarily chosen vectors perpendicular”
to p’ and to one another. Owing to the eigenvalues of p forming
a continuous range, there are a continuous range of stationary
states, giving us the continuous basic kets |p'l’>. However, the fore-
going theory was built up in terms of discrete basic kets |x’> for a
boson. There are two formalisms which one may use for getting over

this discrepancy.
﻿236 THEORY OF RADIATION § 62

The first consists in replacing the continuous three-dimensional
distribution of eigenvalues for p by a large number of discrete points
lying very close together, forming a dust spread over the whole three-
dimensional p-space. Let sp, be the density of the dust (the number
of points per unit volume) in the neighbourhood of any point p’.
Then sp must be large and positive, but is otherwise an arbitrary
function of p’. An integral over the p-space may be replaced by a
sum over the dust of points, in accordance with the formula

Jf [PW dpi dp, dp, = ¥ fp')sp*, (52)

which formula provides the basis of the passage from continuous p’
values to discrete ones and vice versa. Any problem can be worked
out in terms of the discrete p’ values, for which the theory of §§ 59-61
can be used, and the results can be transformed back to refer to con-

tinuous p’ values. The arbitrary density sp. should then disappear
from the results.

The second formalism consists in modifying the equations of the
theory of §§ 59-61 so as to make them apply to the case of a con-
‘ tinuous range of basic kets |a’>, by replacing sums by integrals and
replacing the 6 symbol in the commutation relations (11) by & func-
tions, so far as concerns the variables with continuous eigenvalues.
Each of these formalisms has some advantages and some disadvan-
tages. The first is usually more convenient for physical discussion,
the second for mathematical development. Both will be developed
here and one or other will be used according to which is more suitable
at the moment.
The Hamiltonian describing an assembly of photons interacting
with an atom will be of the general form (40), with the coefficients
Hp, Uz, Uy, V,n involving the atom variables. This Hamiltonian may

b :
e€ written Hp = Hp-+Ho+Hp, (53)

where Hp is the energy of the atom alone, H - is the energy of the
assembly of photons alone,

Hp = 2,?v op (54)

vp being the frequency of a photon of momentum p’, and Hg is the
interaction energy, which can be evaluated from analogy with the
classical theory, as will be shown in the next section. The whole
system can be treated by a perturbation method as discussed in the
﻿§ 62 APPLICATION TO PHOTONS 237

preceding section, Hp, and H, providing the energy (41) of the
unperturbed system and Hg being the perturbation energy, which
gives rise to transition processes in which photons are emitted and
absorbed and the atom jumps from one stationary state to another.

We saw in the precéding section that the probability of an absorp-
tion process is proportional to the number of bosons originally in the
state from which a boson is absorbed. From this we can infer that
the probability of a photon being absorbed from a beam of radiation
incident on an atom is proportional to the intensity of the beam.
We also saw that the probability of an emission process is propor-
tional to the number of bosons originally in the state concerned plus
one. To interpret this result we must make a careful study of the
relations involved in replacing the continuous range of photon states
by a discrete set.

Let us neglect for the present the polarization variable 1. Let
[p’p> be the normalized ket corresponding to the discrete photon
state p’. Then from (22) of § 16

> |p’D><p’p| = 1,
which gives from (52)

| [p'D><p'D [sy dp’ = 1, (55)

dp’ being written for dp;,dp,,dp,, for brevity. Now if |p’) is the basic
ket corresponding to the continuous state p’, we have according to

24) of § 16
Coens _[ipd<p'i ay’ =1,

which shows, on comparison with (55); that

[p> = [p'D>sp. (56)

The connexion between |p’> and |p’D) is like the connexion between
the basic kets when one changes the weight function of the representa-
tion, as shown by (38) of § 16.

With nj, photons in each discrete photon state p’, the Gibbs
density p for the assembly of photons is, according to (68) of § 33,

p => [p’D>n,<p’p| = | |p’D>n,<p'D|sy dp!

Pp
= | [pnp <p’) dp’ (57)

with the help of (56). The number of photons per unit volume in the
﻿238 THEORY OF RADIATION § 62

neighbourhood of any point x’ is then <x’|p|x’>, according to (73)
of § 33. From (57) this equals

(x'|plx'> = | <x'ip mp <p’ |x’) ap’
= [ hn, Bp’ (58)

if one puts in the value of the transformation function <¢x’|p’> given
by (54) of § 23. Equation (58) expresses the number of photons per
unit volume as an integral over the momentum space, so the inte-
grand in (58) can be interpreted as the number of photons per unit
of phase space. We obtain in this way the result that the number of
photons per unit of phase space is equal to h- times the number of
photons per discrete state, in other words, @ cell of volume h? in phase
space is equivalent to a discrete state. This result is a general one,
holding for any kind of particle. If the polarization variable of the
photons is not neglected, the result holds for each of the two indepen-
dent states of polarization.

The momentum of a photon of frequency v is of magnitude hyv/c,
so the element of momentum space

dp, dp, dp, = Wc-v dvdu,

dw being an element of solid angle for the direction of the vector p.
Thus a distribution of photons with nj, per discrete state, which is
equivalent to a distribution of h-nj,d?nd*x photons in an element
of volume dz and an element of momentum space d°p, equals a
distribution of nj, c~*v? dvdwd'x photons in an element of volume da
and a frequency range @v and direction of motion dw. This corre-
sponds to an energy density n, kc-*)> per unit solid angle per unit
frequency range, or an intensity per unit frequency range (i.e. an
energy crossing unit area per unit time per unit frequency range) of

amount L, =n, hvIc2. (59)

The result that the probability of a photon being emitted is pro-
portional to n,,+1, 2,, being the number of photons initially present
in the discrete state concerned, can now be interpreted as the proba-
bility being proportional to £,,+-Av*/c?, where J,, is the intensity of
the incident radiation per unit frequency range in the neighbourhood
of the frequency of the emitted photon and having the same polariza-
tion 1 as the emitted photon. Thus with no incident radiation there
is still a certain amount of emission, but the emission is increased or
﻿§ 62 APPLICATION TO PHOTONS 239

stimulated by incident radiation in the same direction and having the
same frequency and polarization as the emitted radiation. The
present theory of radiation thus completes the imperfect one of § 45
by giving both stimulated and spontaneous emission. The ratio it
gives for the two kinds of emission, namely J,, : hv?/c?, is in agreement
with that provided by Einstein’s theory of statistical equilibrium
mentioned in § 45.

The probability of a photon being scattered from the state p’l’ to
the state p"l’ is proportional to ny1(Myy+1), the n’s being the
numbers of photons initially in the discrete states concerned. We can
interpret this result as the probability being proportional to

Dry (Tye bho"9/c*). (60)
Similarly for a more general radiative process in which several
photons are emitted and absorbed, the probability is proportional
to a factor J,, for each absorbed photon and a factor [,+-Av*/c? for
each emitted photon. Thus the process is stimulated by incident

radiation in the same direction and with the same frequency and
polarization as any of the emitted photons.

63. The interaction energy between photons and an atom

We shall now determine the interaction energy between an atom
and an assembly of photons, ie. the Hg of equation (53), from
analogy with the classical expression for the interaction energy
between an atom and a field of radiation. For simplicity we shall
suppose the atom to consist of a single electron moving in an electro-
static field of force. The field of radiation may be described by a
scalar and a vector potential. These potentials are to a certain extent
arbitrary and may be chosen so that the scalar potential vanishes.
The field is then completely described by the vector potential A,, A,,
A,, or A. The change that the field. causes in the Hamiltonian
describing the atom is now, as explained at the beginning of § 41,

1 -&a\7 nol  @
Hg = 5,-|(p+54) P*| ag (Pe A) +

e2

Qmc* AY (81)

This is the classical interaction energy. The A that occurs here should
be the value of the vector potential at the point where the electron is
momentarily situated. It is, however, a good enough approximation
if we take this A to be the vector potential at some fixed point in the
atom, such as the nucleus, provided we are dealing with radiation
whose wavelength is large compared with the dimensions of the atom.
﻿240 THEORY OF RADIATION § 63

Let us first consider the field of radiation classically and ignore its
interaction with the atom. The vector potential A satisfies, according
to Maxwell’s theory, the equations

A = 0, divA = 0, (62)

being short for 6°/c? dt? 0?/éx*— @*/ay?— 6?/éz2, The first of these
equations shows that A can be resolved into Fourier components in
the form

A= f fA, etka i2minel 4 A gitkx) nine 3p, (63)

each Fourier component representing a train of waves moving with
the velocity of light, described by a vector k whose direction gives
the direction of motion of the waves and whose magnitude |k]| is
connected with their frequency v, by

Qavy, = c[k]. (64)
The vector k is just the momentum of a photon which the quantum
theory would associate with these waves, divided by #. For each
value of k we have an amplitude A,, which is in general a complex
vector, and the integral in (63) extends over the whole of the three-
dimensional k-space. The second of equations (62) gives -

(k, Ay) = 0, (65)
showing that, for each value of k, A; is perpendicular to k. This
expresses that the waves are transverse waves. A, 1s determined by

its two components in two directions perpendicular to each other and

to k, these two components corresponding to two independent states
of linear polarization.

The total energy of the radiation is given by the volume integral]
Hy == (87)-4 [ (S24 #) Bx (66)
taken over the whole of space, where the electric field € and the

magnetic field # of the radiation are given by

= Af = curlA. (67)

Using standard formulas of vector analysis, we have
div[A x Af] = (#, curl A)—(A, curl #) = Jf—(A, curl curl A)
== A+ (A, VA)
with the help of the second of equations (62). Thus (66) becomes,
﻿§63 INTERACTION ENERGY BETWEEN PHOTONS AND AN ATOM 241

with neglect of a term which can be transformed to a surface integral
at infinity,

(l/aA dA

H. = 8 -i je ——;3 =

By substituting for A here its value given by (63), we can get the

energy of the radiation in terms of the Fourier amplitudes A,. The

energy of the radiation is constant (since we are now ignoring the

interaction of the radiation and the atom), so in this calculation we

may take ¢ = 0. This means taking

with the help of formula (49) of §23, 6(k+k’) being the product of
three factors, one for each component of k. Hence

We can replace the continuous distribution of k-values by a dust of
discrete k-values,, like we did with the p-values in the preceding
section. The integral (71) then goes over, according to formula (52),

into the sum Hp = Aq? >) k?(A,, A,)sg',

﻿242 THEORY OF RADIATION § 63

‘the summation with respect to | referring to two directions | perpen-

pendent stationary state for a photon.

The field quantities € and # at any point x can be looked upon
as dynamical variables. The quantities

— Qrivyt A xe 4... gD RL
Aggy = Aggy 87S, Ayy = Ayer

are then dynamical variables at time #, since they are connected with
& and # at various points x at time ¢ by equations which do not
involve #, as follows from (63) and (67). A,, is constant, so A, varies
with ¢ according to the simple harmonic law. Thus A,, is like the 7,
of a harmonic oscillator, defined by (3) of § 34, the w of the oscillator
being 27v,. We may take each A,,, to be proportional to the », of
some harmonic oscillator and then the field of radiation becomes a
set of harmonic oscillators.

Let us now pass over to the quantum theory and take the A,yy, Ax
to be dynamical variables in the Heisenberg picture. The expression
(72) for the energy may be retained unchanged, the order in which
the factors A,,, Ay, there occur being the correct one to give no zero-
point energy. The A,, then still vary with time according to the e
law and may still be taken to be proportional to the 7,’s of harmonic
oscillators. The factor of proportionality may be obtained by equat-
ing (72) to the expression (39) for the energy, with the label a replaced
by the two labels k and I and with Av, for iw,. This gives

de® > KA yy Ayy Se? = 2 hy Meu Tu:

the suffix ¢ being inserted to show that we are dealing with Heisenberg
dynamical variables (as we should when transferring equations of the
classical theory to the quantum theory). Hence, using (64),

47? Ay = ch yy Sh, (73)

with neglect of an unimportant arbitrary phase factor. In this way
the Heisenberg dynamical variables 1,y, which describe the field of
radiation as a set of oscillators, are introduced. The commutation
relations between the 7, and 7, are known, being given by (11), so
equation (73) fixes the commutation relations between the A,, and
Ay, It thus fixes the commutation relations between the potentials
A and the field quantities € and # at various points x at the time J.
(Incidentally, the commutation relations of the Ay, 4 are fixed,
﻿§63 INTERACTION ENERGY BETWEEN PHOTONS AND AN ATOM 243

so the commutation relation of two potential or field quantities at
two different times is also fixed.)

We can still use (73) when the interaction between the field of
radiation and the atom is taken into account. This involves assuming
that the interaction does not affect the commutation relations .
between the potentials and field quantities at a given time. The
interaction causes the 7,,,s to cease to vary according to the simple
harmonic law and the oscillators to cease to be harmonic. Thus it
may affect the commutation relation between two potential or field
quantities at two different times.

We can now take over the interaction energy (61) into the quantum.

Taking the atomic nucleus to be at the origin we get, by substituting

With the model of the atom we are using, the interaction energy
appears as a linear plus a quadratic function in the y’s and 7's. The
linear terms give rise to emission and absorption processes, the

Hy =

﻿244 THEORY OF RADIATION § 63

quadratic ones to scattering processes and processes in which two
photons are absorbed or emitted simultaneously. The order of the
factors 7 and 7 in the quadratic terms is not determined by the
procedure of working from the classical theory, but this order is
unimportant, since a change in it merely changes Hy by a constant.

The matrix element of Hg referring to the emission of a photon
into the discrete state KI, or into the discrete state p’l, as it may also
be labelled, with the atom jumping from state «° to state a’, is

since s, == s,/%. The p, occurring here, referring to the momentum
of the electron, is, of course, quite distinct from the other letters p,
referring to the momentum of the emitted photon. To avoid con-—
fusion we shall replace the electron momentum p by mx, these two
dynamical variables being the same for the unperturbed atom. Pass-
ing over to continuous photon states by means of the conjugate
imaginary of equation (56), we get

<p'Dle’|Hg|a°> =

Similarly, the matrix element of Hy referring to the absorption of a

nee e ,
<p'Vo |Hg|p°l°a> = Orhimly't (LT) by-aas (77)
there being two terms in (74) which contribute to it. These matrix
elements will be used in the next section. The matrix elements
referring to the simultaneous absorption or emission of two photons
may be written down in the same way, but they lead to physical

effects too small to be of practical importance.

64. Emission, absorption, and scattering of radiation

We can now determine directly the coefficients of emission, absorp-
tion, and scattering of radiation by substituting in the formulas of
﻿§ 64 EMISSION, ABSORPTION, AND SCATTERING OF RADIATION 245

Chapter VIII the values for the matrix elements given by (75), (76),
and (77).

For determining the emission probability we can use formula
(56) of §53. This shows that for an atom in a state a? the proba-
bility per unit time per unit solid angle of its spontaneously emitting
a photon and dropping to a state a’ of lower energy is

2 2
Now the energy and momentum of a photon of frequency v are
W = hy, P = hy/e.
Again, from the Heisenberg law (20) of § 29,
Cot! |e == — 2rrtv(a?a')<ar" |x|,
v(a%') being the frequency connected with transitions from state «?
to state «’, which in une present case is just the frequency v of the
emitted radiation. These results substituted in (78) make the emis-
sion coefficient reduce to
(2arv)8
hes
To obtain the rate of emission of energy per unit solid angle for a
specified polarization, we must multiply this by hv. This gives for
the total rate of emission of energy in all directions

4 (2av)*

3 8

which is in agreement with expression (34) of § 45 and justifies Heisen-
berg’s assumption for the interpretation of his matrix elements.

In the same way the absorption coefficient, given by formula

(59) of § 58, becomes for photons

4n*h? Wile 1 he 2 8arFp

BP {h Gmye Male) = =

This absorption coefficient refers to an incident beam of one photon

crossing unit area per unit time per unit energy range. if we take

one per unit frequency range instead of energy range, as is usual
when dealing with radiation, the absorption coefficient becomes

This result is the same as (32) of § 45, if we substitute for the #,

there the energy hy of a single photon. Thus. the elementary theory

[<a‘|ex|a®|?, (80)

|<ox" Jen |x> |.
﻿246 THEORY OF RADIATION § 64

of § 45, in which the radiation field is treated as an external perturba-
ton, gives the correct value for the absorption coefficient.

This agreement between the elementary theory and the present
theory could be inferred from general arguments. The two theories
differ only in that the field quantities all commute with one another
in the elementary theory and satisfy definite commutation relations
in the present theory, and this difference becomes unimportant for
strong fields. Thus the two theories must give the same absorption
and emission when strong fields are concerned. Since both theories
give the rate of absorption proportional to the intensity of the inci-
dent beam, the agreement must hold also for weak fields in the case of
absorption. In the same way the stimulated part of the emission in the
present theory must agree with the emission in the elementary theory.

Let us now consider scattering. The direct scattering coefficient is
given by formula (38) of § 50. Such scattering of photons will not be
accompanied by any change of state of the atom on account of the
factor 6,0 in the expression for the matrix element (77). Thus the
final energy W’ of the photon will equal its initial energy W°. The
scattering coefficient now reduces to

e4/méct. (1/19).

This is the same as that given by classical mechanics for the scattering
of radiation by a free electron. We thus see that the direct scatter-
ing of radiation by an electron in an atom is independent of the atom
and is correctly given by the classical theory. This result, it should
be remembered, holds only provided the wavelength of the radiation
is large compared with the dimensions of the atom.

The direct scattering is a mathematical concept and cannot be
separated out experimentally from the total scattering, given by
formula (44) of § 51. Let us see what this total scattering is in the
case of photons. We must be careful in our application of formula
(44) of §51. The summation > in this formula may be considered as

representing the contribution to the scattering of double transitions
consisting of transitions firstly from the initial state to state k and
secondly from state & to the final state. The first transition may be
an absorption of the incident photon and the second an emission of
the required scattered photon, but it is also possible for the first
transition to be the emission and the second the absorption. It is
clear from the general nature of the method used for deriving formula
﻿§ 64 EMISSION, ABSORPTION, AND SCATTERING OF RADIATION 247

(44) of § 51 that both these kinds of double transitions must be in-
cluded in the summation ¥ when this formula is applied to photons,
i

although only the first of them appears in the actual derivation given
in § 51, as the possibility of the particle being created or annihilated

was not taken into account there.
We use zero, single prime, and double prime to refer to the initial,

tinal, and intermediate states of the atom respectively, and zero and
single prime to refer to the absorbed and emitted photons respec- -
tively. Then, for the double transition of absorption followed by
emission, we must take for the matrix elements

<b|V|p%>, — <p’a’|V|k>
of the formula (44) of § 51
(k|V |p = <a" |Ho|pla, — <p’a’|V [b> = <p'l’a'| Hale".
Also EH! —E,, = hv +-Hp(0°)—Ap(«") = hfy°—v(a"o)],
where hy(e"0®) = Hp(a”)— ‘os

Similarly, for the double transition of emission followed by absorption
we must take
(k|V|p%> = <p'V'a"|Ho{a, — <p’a’|Vik> = <a'|Hg|pl’a">
and
E' —E, = b+ Hp(«°)—Hp(2")—h hv’ = —hfp' + (00°) ],
there being now two photons, of frequencies v® and v’, in existence
for the intermediate state. Substituting in (44) of § 51 the values of

the matrix elements given by (75), (76), and (77), we get for the

obtained by these authors from analogies with the classical theory
of dispersion.

The fact that the various terms in (82) can be combined to give
the result (85) justifies the assumption made in deriving formula (44)
of § 51, that the matrix elements <p’a’|V|p’e”> of the interaction
energy are of the second order of smallness compared with the
<p'a’ |V|k> ones, at any rate when the scattered particles are photons.

summed over all permutations P, the + or — sign being taken
according to whether P is eyen or odd. Applied to the ket (1) it gives

WIE S + Plot ob o§...09> = AlatoPa®...0%>, (3')
a ket corresponding to a state for an assembly of u’ fermions. The
﻿§ 65 AN ASSEMBLY OF FERMIONS 249

ket (3’) is normalized provided the individual fermion kets |a”, |a”,...
are all different, otherwise it is zero. In this respect the ket (3’) is
simpler than the ket (3). However, (3’) is more complicated than (3)
in that (3') depends on the order in which a”, 2, o”,... occur in it,
being subject to a change of sign if an odd permutation is applied
to this order.

We can, as before, introduce the numbers 7), No, 3,... of fermions
in the states ao, o, «,... and treat them as dynamical variables or
observables. They each have as eigenvalues only 0 and 1. They form
a complete set of commuting observables for the assembly of fermions.
The basic kets of a representation with the n’s diagonal may be taken
to be connected with the kets (3’) by the equation

Alotaboe...a%> = |, ngng...> (6’)
corresponding to (6), the n’s being connected with the variables
at, a, of... by equation (4). The -- sign is needed in (6’) since, for
given n’”’s, the occupied states «%, «”, a°,... are fixed but not their
order, so that the sign of the left-hand side of (6’) is not fixed. To
set up a rule which determines the sign in (6’), we must arrange all
the states « for a fermion arbitrarily in some standard order. The
a's oceurring in the left-hand side of (6’) form a certain selection from
all the a’s and the standard order for all the a’s will give a standard
order for this selection. We now make the rule that the + sign should
occur in (6’) if the «’s on the left-hand side can be brought into their
standard order by an even permutation and the — sign if an odd
permutation is required. Owing to the complexity of this rule,
the representation with the basic kets |n,ngn3...> is not a very
useful one.

If the number of fermions in the assembly is variable, we can set
up the complete set of kets

Id, Ja, Ajatx®>, Alatarae>, (9’)
corresponding to (9). A general ket is now expressible as a sum of
the various kets (9’).

To continue with the development we introduce a set of linear
operators n, 7, one pair 7,, 7, corresponding to each fermion state «*,
satisfying the commutation relations

Na Not No Na = 9
Na ot No fa = 0, (11’)
Dao Qa = Sap:
﻿250 THEORY OF RADIATION § 65

These relations are like (11) with a -+ sign instead of a — on the left-
hand side. They show that, for a + 6, 7, and 7, anticommute with
n» and 7, while, putting b = a, they give

m= 9, = 0,  FaMat Nata = 1. (11’)
To verify that the relations (11’) are consistent, we note that linear
operators y, 7 satisfying the conditions (11’) can be constructed in
the following way. For each state a we take a set of linear operators
Fxq> Sy Fcq like the o,, o,, o, introduced in § 37 to describe the spin
of an electron and such that o,,, Gyq; 6,4 commute with 9,,, Op, %»
for 6 a. We also take an independent set of linear operators €,,
one for each state «*, which all anticommute with one another and
have their squares unity, and commute with all the o variables.
Then, putting

Na = 2$a(Fra—tya)> Na = HalOrattya),
we have all the conditions (11’) satisfied.
From (11")

("4 ja)” = Naa Na Ie = Nall—e Na) a = Na Na
This is an algebraic equation for 7,7,, showing that »,7, is an
observable with the eigenvalues 0 and 1. Also y, 7, commutes with
1, i, for 6 4a. These results allow us to put

Nata = Na (12')
the same as (12). From (11”) we get now
Na Ve = I—n,, (13)

the equation corresponding to (13),
Let us write the normalized ket which is an eigenket of all the n’s
belonging to the eigenvalues zero as |0>. Then

Ng\O> = 0,
so from (12’) CO| M4 Fg|O> = 0.
Hence FqlO> = 9, . (15')

like (15). Again
showing that 7,,|0> is normalized, and

showing that »,|0> is an eigenket of n, belonging to the eigenvalue
unity. It is an eigenket of the other n’s belonging to the eigenvalues
zero, since the other n’s commute with »,. By generalizing the
﻿§ 65 AN ASSEMBLY OF FERMIONS 251

argument we see that 4_ 7p Ne---4y|07 18 normalized and is a simul-
taneous eigenket of all the n’s, belonging to the eigenvalues unity
for Mg Nyy Ney, R, and zero for the other n’s. This enables us to put

Alatoal...07> = 14 Ne Mg|O> (17)
both sides being antisymmetrical in the labels a, 6, c,...,g. We have
here the analogue of (17).

If we pass over to a different set of basic kets [8+> for a fermion,
we can introduce a new set of linear operators 74 correspor.ding to
them. We then find, by the same argument as in the case of bosons,
that the new 7’s are connected with the original ones by (21). This
shows that there is a procedure of second quantization for fermions,
similar to that for bosons, with the only difference that the commu-
tation relations (11’) must be employed for fermions to replace the
commutation relations (11) for bosons.

A symmetrical linear operator Up of the form (22) can be expressed
in terms of the y, 7 variables by a similar method to that used for
bosons. Equation (24) still holds, and so does (25) with S replaced
by A. Instead of (26) we now have

Oy Ney Marg (0 = pa 2 (—)9 1 Nes Ney |0><a|U [z>
= 2 Na 2 (—)’-*n;,* Nay Nag? |O>85x,<4| U\b>, (26’)

nz,i meaning that the factor y,, must be cancelled out, without its
position among the other 7,’s being changed before the cancellation.
Instead of (27) we have

Fe Nay Nag LOD =D (ng? Ney Nae |9 Spe, (27')

so (28) holds unchanged and thus (29) holds unchanged. We have
the same final form (29) for Up in the fermion case as in the boson
case. Similarly, a symmetrical linear operator Vp of the form (30) can

be expressed as v= Se ny (ab |V led) ua Fes (35"}
auc

the same as one of the ways of writing (35).

The foregoing work shows that there is a deep-seated analogy
between the theory of fermions and that of bosons, only slight
changes having to be made in the general equations of the formalism

when one passes from one to the other.
There is, however, a development of the theory of fermions that

has no analogue for bosons. For fermions there are only the two
﻿252 THEORY OF RADIATION § 65

alternatives of a state being occupied or unoccupied and there is
symmetry between these two alternatives. One can demonstrate the
symmetry mathematically by making a transformation which inter-
changes the concepts of ‘occupied’ and ‘unoccupied’, namely

Na = Nas Na = Nar

The creation operators of the unstarred variables are the annihilation
operators of the starred variables, and vice versa. Thestarred variables
are now seen to satisfy the same quantum conditions and to have all
the same properties as the unstarred ones..

If there are only a few unoccupied states, a convenient standard
ket to work with would be the one for which every state is occupied,
namely |0*> satisfying

Mq|0*> = [O*).
It thus satisfies nilo*> = 0,
or ial0*) = 0.

Other states for the assembly will now be represented by

Ta 1 Ne-|0*),
in which variables appear referring to the unoccupied fermion states
a,b,c.... We may look upon these unoccupied fermion states as holes
among the occupied ones and the 7* variables as the operators of
creation of such holes. The holes are just as much physical things
as the original particles and are also fermions.
