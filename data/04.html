<h2>21. Poisson brackets　ポアソン括弧式</h2>
<p>
Our work so far has consisted in setting up a general mathematical
scheme connecting states and observables in quantum mechanics.
One of the dominant features of this scheme is that observables, and
dynamical variables in general, appear in it as quantities which do
not obey the commutative law of multiplication. It now becomes
necessary for us to obtain equations to replace the commutative law
of multiplication, equations that will tell us the value of 7 —§ when
éand 7 are any two observables or dynamical variables. Only when
such equations are known shall we have a complete scheme of
mechanics with which to replace classical mechanics. These new
equations are called quantum conditions or commutation relations.
The problem of finding quantum conditions is not of such a general
character as those we have been concerned with up to the present. Tt
is instead a special problem which presents itself with each particular
dynamical system one is called upon to study. There is, however,
a fairly general method of obtaining quantum conditions, applicable
to a very large class of dynamical systems. This is the method of
classical analogy and will form the main theme of the present chapter.
Those dynamical systems to which this method is not applicable
must be treated individually and special considerations used in each
case. .
The value of classical analogy in the development of quantum
mechanics depends on the fact that classical mechanics provides a
valid description of dynamical systems under certain conditions,
when the particles and bodies composing the systems are sufficiently
massive for the disturbance accompanying an observation to be
negligible. Classical mechanics must therefore be a limiting case of
quantum mechanics. We should thus expect to find that important
concepts in classical mechanics correspond to important concepts in
quantum mechanics, and, from an understanding of the general
nature of the analogy between classical and quantum mechanics, we
may hope to get laws and theorems in quantum mechanies appearing
as simple generalizations of well-known results in classical mechanics;
in particular we may hope to get the quantum conditions appearing
﻿§ 21 POISSON BRACKETS 85

as a simple generalization of the classical law that all dynamical
variables commute.

Let us take a dynamical system composed of a number of particles
in interaction. As independent dynamical variables for dealing with
the system we may use the Cartesian coordinates of all the particles
and the corresponding Cartesian components of velocity of the par-
ticles. It is, however, more convenient to work with the momentum
components instead of the velocity components. Let us call the
coordinates q,, 7 going from 1 to three times the number of particles,
and the corresponding momentum components p,. The q’s and p's
are called canonical coordinates and momenta.

The method of Lagrange’s equations of motion involves introdu-
cing coordinates g, and momenta p, in a more general way, applicable
also for a system not composed of particles (e.g. a system containing
rigid bodies). These more general q’s and p’s are also called canonical
coordinates and momenta. Any dynamical variable is expressible in
terms of a set of canonical coordinates and momenta.

An important concept in general dynamical theory is the Powsson

Bracket. Any two dynamical variables u and v have a P.B. (Poisson
Bracket) which we shall denote by [u,v], defined by

u and v being regarded as functions of a set of canonical coordinates
and momenta g, and :, for the purpose of the differentiations. The
right-hand side of (1) is independent of which set of canonical
coordinates and momenta are used, this being a consequence of the
general definition of canonical coordinates and momenta, so the

P.B. [u,v] is well defined.
The main properties of P.B.s, which follow at once from their

detinition (1), are

[vo] = —[», a], (2)
[u,¢] = 9, (3)

where c is a number (which may be considered as a special case of a
dynamical variable),

[ea-+ ete, 2] = [uy 0] + [tao (4)

(5)
[u, % v2] = [w, Xoo +v,[u, v9].

Also the identity

[us fo, w]} +L fo, w]]+[w, fu, of] = 0 (6)
is easily verified. Equations (4) express that the P.B. [u,v] involves
u and v linearly, while equations (5) correspond to the ordinary rules
for differentiating a product.

Let us try to introduce a quantum P.B. which shall be the analogtie
of the classical one. We assume the quantum P.B. to satisfy all the
conditions (2) to (6), it being now necessary that the order of the
factors u, and wu, in the first of equations (5) should be preserved
throughout the equation, as in the way we have here written it, and
similarly for the v, and v, in the second of equations (5). These condi-
tions are already sufficient to determine the form of the quantum
P.B. uniquely, as may be seen from the following argument. We can

evaluate the P.B. [u, ug, v v,| in two different ways, since we can use
either of the two formulas (5) first, thus,

[24g Uy, % Vy] = [ey ry Vp jeg + Uy[ Mg, Vy Vo |
= {[ uy, Myre 0,[ 4, Y2]}4.-+ Uy{[ Ug, ¥ Vg +r[Ue, Vel}

= (2p, Uy [9 Uy +, [ Uy, Vy [Ug-+ Uy[ Uy, Vy Vg Uy Yy[ Ug, V2]

and
[2y Wy, Vy Vp] = [20 My, % [Ue + 0,[ ey Up, Vy]

== (Uy, Oy Jy Vet tye, Vy Uo +0 [Uy, Ve }lo +, Uy[ ty, Ve].

Equating these two results, we obtain

[Uys Vy](ty Va— Uy Uy) == (Uy p01 Uy) [ Ue, Ve].
Since this condition holds with u, and v, quite independent of u, and

Ve, we must have . ,
, Uy 01-0, Uy = tL Uy, v4],

Uy Vg— Vy Uy = til Uy, Ve],
where % must not depend on w, and v,, nor on uw and v%, and also
must commute with (u,v,—v,%,). It follows that 4 must be simply
a number. We want the P.B. of two real variables to be real, as in

the classical theory, which requires, from the work at the top of p. 28,
that % shall be a real number when introduced, as here, with the
﻿§ 2] POISSON BRACKETS 87

coefficient i. We are thus led to the following definition for the
quanium P.B. [u,v] of any two variables u and »,

uv—vu = thu, v], (7)

in which #% is a new universal constant. It has the dimensions of
action. In order that the theory may agree with experiment, we
must take 4 equal to h/2:, where h is the universal constant that
was introduced by Planck, known as Planck’s constant. It is easily
verified that the quantum P.B. satisfies all the conditions (2), (3), (4),
(5), and (6). :

The problem of finding quantum conditions now reduces to the
problem of determining P.B.s in quantum mechanics. The strong
analogy between the quantum P.B. defined by (7) and the classical
P.B. defined by (1) leads us to make the assumption that the quantum
P.B.s, or at any rate the simpler ones of them, have the same values
ag the corresponding classical P.B.s. The simplest P.B.s are those
involving the canonical coordinates and momenta themselves and
have the following values in the classical theory :

[dr Ps] == Sy.
We therefore assume that the corresponding quantum P.B.s also

have the values given by (8). By eliminating the quantum P.B.s
with the help of (7), we obtain the equations

Vr Is — Fs Vr =F 0, PrPs—P3Py = 0, (9)
VPs Ps Ir = 8,5,

which are the fundamental quantum conditions. They show us where
the lack of commutability among the canonical coordinates and
momenta lies. They also provide us with a basis for calculating com-
mutation relations between other dynamical variables. For instance,
if € and y are any two functions of the q’s and »’s expressible as
power series, we may express én—né or [£,], by repeated applica-
tions of the laws (2), (3), (4), and (5), in terms of the elementary
P.B.s given in (8) and so evaluate it. The result is often, in simple
cases, the same as the classical result, or departs from the classical
result only through requiring a special order for factors in a product,
this order being, of course, unimportant in the classical theory. Even
when é and 7 are more general functions of the q’s and p’s not ex-
pressible as power series, equations (9) are still sufficient to fix the
﻿88 THE QUANTUM CONDITIONS § 21

value of £y—7n&, as will become clear from the following work.
Equations (9) thus give the solution of the problem of finding the
quantum conditions, for all those dynamical systems which have a
classical analogue and which are describable in terms of canonical
coordinates and momenta. This does not include all possible systems
in quantum mechanics. ;
Equations (7) and (9) provide the foundation for the analogy
between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics. They show
that classical mechanics may be regarded as the limiting case of quantum
mechanics when fi tends to zero. A P.B. in quantum mechanics is a
purely algebraic notion and is thus a rather more fundamental con-
cept than a classical P.B., which can be defined only with reference to
a set of canonical coordinates and momenta. For this reason canonical
coordinates and momenta are ofless importance in quantum mechanics
than in classical mechanics; in fact, we may have a system in quan-
tum mechanics for which canonical coordinates and momenta do
not exist and we can still give a meaning to P.B.s. Such a system
would be one without a classical analogue and we should not be able
to obtain its quantum conditions by the method here described.
From equations (9) we see that two variables with different suffixes
rand s always commute. It follows that any function of q, and p,
will commute with any function of g, and p, when s differs from r.
Different values of r correspond to different degrees of freedom of the
dynamical system, so we get the result that dynamical variables
referring to different degrees of freedom commute. This law, as we have
derived it from (9), is proved only for dynamical systems with
classical analogues, but we assume it to hold generally. In this way
we can make a start on the problem of finding quantum conditions
for dynamical systems for which canonical coordinates and momenta
do not exist, provided we can give a meaning to different degrees of
freedom, as we may be able to do with the help of physical insight.
We can now see the physical meaning of the division, which was
discussed in the preceding section, of the dynamical variables into
sets, any member of one set commuting with any member of another.
Each set corresponds to certain degrees of freedom, or possibly just
one degree of freedom. The division may correspond to the physical
process of resolving the dynamical system into its constituent parts,
each constituent being capable of existing by itself as a physical
system, and the various constituents having to be brought into
﻿§ 21 POISSON BRACKETS 89

interaction with one another to produce the original system. Alterna-
tively the division may be merely a mathematical procedure of
resolving the dynamical system into degrees of freedom which cannot
be separated physically, e.g. the system consisting of a particle with
internal structure may be divided into the degrees of freedom deserib-
ing the motion of the centre of the particle and those describing the
internal structure.

22. Schrédinger’s representation

Let us consider a dynamical system with n degrees of freedom
having a classical analogue, and thus describable in terms of canonical
coordinates and momenta q,,p, (r = 1,2,...,.2). We assume that the
coordinates q, are all observables and have continuous ranges of egen-
values, these assumptions being reasonable from the physical signifi-
cance of the q’s. Let us set up a representation with the q’s diagonal.
The question arises whether the q’s form a complete commuting set
for this dynamical system. It seems pretty obvious from inspection
that they do. We shall here assume that they do, and the assumption
will be justified later (see top of p. 92). With the q’s forming a
complete commuting set, the representation is fixed except for the
arbitrary phase factors in it.

Let us consider first the case of n = 1, so that there is only one ¢

and p, satisfying - gp—pq = th. (10)

Any ket may be written in the standard ket notation $(q)>. From it
we can form another ket di/dq>, whose representative is the deriva-
tive of the original one. This new ket is a linear function of the
original one and is thus the result of some linear operator applied to
the original one. Calling this linear operator d/dq, we have

ad ds

—ub> =. 1

ib =e (qy
Equation (11) holding for all functions ¢ defines the linear operator

djdq. We have d
ip = ° (12)

Let us treat the linear operator d/dq according to the general theory
of linear operators of § 7. We should then be able to apply it to a bra
<d(q), the product <¢d/dq being defined, according to (3) of § 7, by

(oz \i> = <#fs.99| (13)

provided the contributions from the limits of integration vanish.
This gives '

showing that - <p-— (16)

Thus d/dg operating to the left on the conjugate complex of a wave
function has the meaning of minus differentiation with respect to q.

The validity of this result depends on our being able to make the
passage from (14) to (15), which requires that we must restrict our-
selves to bras and kets corresponding to wave functions that satisfy
suitable boundary conditions. The conditions usually holding in
practice are that they vanish at the boundaries. (Somewhat more
general conditions will be given in the next section.) These conditions
do not limit the physical applicability of the theory, but, on the con-
trary, are usually required also on physical grounds. For example,
if g is a Cartesian coordinate of a particle, its eigenvalues run from
—oo to oo, and the physical requirement that the particle has zero
probability of being at infinity leads to the condition that the wave
function vanishes for g == -Loo.

The conjugate complex of the linear operator d/dg can be evaluated
by noting that the conjugate imaginary of d/dg.%> or dit/dg> is
<dij/dq, or —<hd/dq from (16). Thus the conjugate complex of d/dq
is —d/dg, so d/dg is a pure imaginary linear operator.

To get the representative of d/dg we note that, from an application
of formula (63) of § 20,

I> = — g")>, (17)

so that =a" = sla q’)>; (18)
1

dh ‘|s-|9"> = =58(q'—9"). 18

and hence izle aig (q’—q") (19)

The representative of d/dq involves the derivative of the 5 function.
﻿§ 22 SCHRODINGER’S REPRESENTATION 91

Let us work out the commutation relation connecting d/dg with q.
We have

dS = “ae _
aq = ag’ az rh. (20)
Since this holds for any ket i we have
ad fe

Comparing this result with aoe we see that —iid/dq satisfies the
same commutation relation with q that p does.
To extend the foregoing work to the case of arbitrary n, we write

the general ket as $(q,...¢,)> = ~> and introduce the n linear opera-
tors 8/éq, (r = 1,...,.), which can operate on it in accordance with

the formula aby
ag; = 7 aq,” 22)
corresponding to (11). We have
a =0 (28)

corresponding to (12). Provided we restrict ourselves to bras and
kets corresponding to wave functions satisfying suitable boundary
conditions, these linear menos can operate also on bras, in accor-
dance with the formula ag

$5 aq, ~ eq,

corresponding to (16). Thus @/ég, can operate to the left on the
conjugate complex of a wave function, when it has the meaning of
minus partial differentiation with respect to g,. We find as before
that each 0/ég, is a pure imaginary linear operator. Corresponding
to (21) we have the commutation relations

Comparing (25) and (27) with (9), we see that the linear operators
— ih 8/éq, satisfy the same commutation relations with the qs and with
each other that the p’s do.
﻿92 THE QUANTUM CONDITIONS § 22

It would be possible to take
p, = —iha leq, (28)
without getting any inconsistency. This possibility enables us to see
that the q’s must form a complete commuting set of observables,

since it means that any function of the q’s and p’s could be taken
to be a function of the q’s and —7# 0/éq’s and then could not commute

‘with all the q’s unless it is a function of the q’s only.

The equations (28) do not necessarily hold. But in any case the
quantities p,-+ 1% 0/éq, each commute with all the q’s, so each of them
is a function of the q’s, from Theorem 2 of § 19. Thus

Since p, and —72%/éq, are both real, f(g) must be real. For any
function f of the g’s we have

a 72, Of
glb =fep+eM,
a ee (30)

aq, "6g, 8,”
With the help of (29) we can now deduce the general formula

showing that

This formula may be written in P.B. notation

when it is the same as in the classical theory, as follows from (1).
Multiplying (27) by (—2h)? and substituting for —2h d/ag, and — itt 0/dq,
their values given by (29), we get

which reduces, with the help of the quantum condition p,p, = ,P,, to

Pritt Ps = Dba tts Pe
This reduces further, with the help of (31), to

af.lea, = afl 2de (33)
showing that the functions f. are all of the form
J, = &F /6q, (34)
with F independent of r. Equation (29) now becomes
Dy, = —1h 0/0q,+0F /Gq,. (35)

We have been working with a representation which is fixed to the
extent that the g’s must be diagonal in it, but which contains arbitrary
﻿§ 22 SCHRODINGER’S REPRESENTATION 93

phase factors. If the phase factors are changed, the operators 0/dq,
get changed. It will now be shown that, by a suitable change in the
phase factors, the function £ in (35) can be made to vanish, so that
equations (28) are made to hold.

Using stars to distinguish quantities referring to the new repre-
sentation with the new phase factors, we shall have the new basic
bras connected with the previous ones by

ee Tn* | = OCG Gal (36)
where y’ = y(q') is a real function of the g’’s. The new representa-
tive of a ket is ev’ times the old one, showing that e”s>* = J), so
we get * — ¢-iy) (37)
as the connexion between the new standard ket and the original one.
The new linear operator (0/0g,)* satisfies, corresponding to (22),

a \* eb ., Oxf

with the help of (37). Using (22), this gives

( Q \"w _ ow —_ ctr opy",

24, q
showing that (=) = enity2_ ety, (38)
or, with the help of (30),
(=) -3 im, (39)
éq,} ~ &q,-" a,
By choosing y so that F = fiy+ a constant, (40)
(35) becomes , = —th(d/aq,)*. (41)

Equation (40) fixes y except for an arbitrary constant, so the repre-
sentation is fixed except for an arbitrary constant phase factor.

In this way we see that a representation can be set up in which
the q’s are diagonal and equations (28) hold. This representation is
a very useful one for many problems. It will be called Schrédinger’s
representation, as it was the representation in terms of which Schro-
dinger gave his original formulation of quantum mechanics in 1926.
Schrédinger’s representation exists whenever one has canonical q’s
and p’s, and is completely determined by these q’s and p’s except for
an arbitrary constant phase factor. It owes its great convenience to
its allowing one to express immediately any algebraic function of the
﻿94 THE QUANTUM CONDITIONS § 22

q’s and p’s of the form of a power series in the p’s as an operator of
differentiation, e.g. if f(q;.---.¢ns Di---» Pn) is such a function, we have

FQaves Une Pres Pn) = AQ Uns — 4 2/8Qq —ih d/éq,,), (42)

provided we preserve the order of the factors in a product on substi-
tuting the —ih 0/d9’s for the p’s.
From (23) and (28), we have

Dry == 0. | (43)

Thus the standard ket in Schrédinger’s representation is characterized
by the condition that it is a simultaneous eigenket of all the momenta
belonging to the eigenvalues zero. Some properties of the basic
vectors of Schrédinger’s representation may also be noted. Equation
(22) gives ,

Similarly, equation (24) leads to

23. The momentum representation

Let us take a system with one degree of freedom, describable in
terms of a g and p with the eigenvalues of g running from —oco to 00,
and let us take an eigenket |p’> of p. Its representative in the Schré-
dinger representation, <q'jp’>, satisfies

f f t ‘ t 7 d , t
Pip) = @'\plp> = ear Ip’?
with the help of (45) applied to the case of one degree of freedom.
The solution of this differential equation for <q'|p’> is
<q |p’) = o erat, (47)
where c’ = c(p’) is independent of g’, but may involve 7’.

The representative <q'|p’> does not satisfy the boundary conditions
of vanishing at g’ = -.oo. This gives rise to some difficulty, which
﻿§ 23 THE MOMENTUM REPRESENTATION 95

shows itself up most directly in the failure of the orthogonality
theorem. If we take a second eigenket |p”) of p with representative

q'lp"> =e" alt,

belonging to a different eigenvalue p’, we shall have

<p'lp"> = [ <p'la’> da’ <a'ip"> = ce" | etw'-77H da’. (48)
This integral does not converge according to the usual definition of
convergence. To bring the theory into order, we adopt a new defini-
tion of convergence of an integral whose domain extends to infinity,
analogous to the Cesaro definition of the sum of an infinite series.
With this new definition, an integral whose value to the upper limit
q7’ is of the form cosaq’ or sinag’, with a a real number not zero, is
counted as zero when q’ tends to infinity, i.e. we take the mean value
of the oscillations, and similarly for the lower limit of gq’ tending to
minus infinity. This makes the right-hand side of (48) vanish for
p” # p’, 30 that the orthogonality theorem is restored. Also it makes
the right-hand sides of (13) and (14) equal when <¢ and > are eigen-
vectors of p, so that eigenvectors of p become permissible vectors to
use with the operator d/dg. Thus the boundary conditions that the
representative of a permissible bra or ket has to satisfy become
extended to allow the representative to oscillate like cos.aq’ or sin.aq’
as q’ goes to infinity or minus infinity.
For p” very close to p’, the right-hand side of (48) involves a 6
function. To evaluate it, we need the formula

J eter dg = Ir 8(a) (49)
for real a, which may be proved as follows. The formula evidently
holds for a different from zero, as both sides are then zero. Further

we have, for any continuous function j(a),

no  @ a «©
| f(a) da | eiar day = | f(a) da 2a-1 sinag = 2nf(0) ,
in the limit when g tends to infinity. A more complicated argument
shows that we get the same result if instead of the limits g and —g
we put g, and —g,, and then let g, and g, tend to infinity in different
ways (not too widely different). This shows the equivalence of both
sides of (49) as factors in an integrand, which proves the formula.
﻿96 THE QUANTUM CONDITIONS § 23
With the help of (49), (48) becomes

= |c’|?h8(p'—p"). (50)

We have obtained an eigenket of p belonging to any real eigenvalue
p', its representative being given by (47). Any ket |X) can be ex-
panded in terms of these eigenkets of p, since its representative
<q'|X> can be expanded in terms of the representatives (47) by
Fourier analysis. It follows that the momentum p is an observable,
in agreement with the experimental result that momenta can be
observed.

A symmetry now appears between q and p. Hach of them is an
observable with eigenvalues extending from --co to o, and the
commutation relation connecting g and p, equation (10), remains
invariant if we interchange q and p and write —i for 7. We have set
up @ representation in which q is diagonal and p = —zid/dg. It
follows from the symmetry that we can also set up a representation
in which » is diagonal and

q = thdjdp, (51)

the operator d/dp being defined by a procedure similar to that used
for d/dg. This representation will be called the momentum representa-
tion. It is less useful than the previous Schrédinger representation
because, while the Schrédinger representation enables one to express
as an operator of differentiation any function of g and p that is a
power series in p, the momentum representation enables one so to
express any function of g and » that is a power series in g, and the
important quantities in dynamics are almost always power series in
gp but are often not power series in g. All the same the momentum
representation is of value for certain problems (see § 50).

Let us calculate the transformation function <q’ |p’> connecting the
two representations. The basic kets |’) of the momentum representa-
tion are eigenkets of p and their Schrédinger representatives <q'|p’>
are given by (47) with the coefficients c’ suitably chosen. The phase
factors of these basic kets must be chosen so as to make (51) hold.
The easiest way to bring in this condition is to use the symmetry
between g and p referred to above, according to which <q‘|p’> must
go over into <p’lq’> if we interchange q’ and yp’ and write —2 for 7.
Now <q'|p’> is equal to the right-hand side of (47) and <p’|q’> to the
﻿§ 23 THE MOMENTUM REPRESENTATION 97

conjugate complex expression, and hence c’ must be independent of
p'. Thus c’ is just a number c. Further, we must have

<p'|p"> = 8(p'—p"),
which shows, on comparison with (50), that |c] = A-?. We can choose
the arbitrary constant phase factor in either representation so as to
make c = h-?, and we then get
<q' ip’) = h-tetpain (52)
for the transformation function. .

The foregoing work may easily be generalized to a system with
n degrees of freedom, describable in terms of n q’s and p’s, with the
eigenvalues of each g running from —co to oo. Each p will then be
an observable with eigenvalues running from —co to oo, and there
will be symmetry between the set of q’s and the set of p’s, the

- commutation relations remaining invariant if we interchange each q,

with the corresponding p, and write —z for 7. A momentum repre-
sentation can be set up in which the p’s are diagonal and each

The transformation function connecting it with the Schrédinger
representation will be given by the product of the transformation

functions for each degree of freedom separately, as is shown by
formula (67) of § 20, and will thus be

Ti Ga--Un| Pt PoP = GIP Ga P2>+- Gn Pn
a= A 2hP +P htt PG Hh, (54)

24. Heisenberg’s principle of uncertainty
For a system with one degree of freedom, the Schrédinger and the
momentum representatives of a ket |X> are connected by

oO

<p'|X> = he# | eth dg’ <q'|X),
| “: | (55)
<q'|X> = b+ [ ef? dp’ (p'|X).

These formulas have an elementary significance. They show that
either of the representatives is given, apart from numerical coefficients,
by the amplitudes of the Fourier components of the other.

It is interesting to apply (55) to a ket whose Schrédinger repre-
sentative consists of what is called a wave packet. This is a function
﻿98 THE QUANTUM CONDITIONS § 24

whose value is very small everywhere outside a certain domain, of
width Aq’ say, and inside this domain is approximately periodic with
a definite frequency.t Ifa Fourier analysis is made of such a wave
packet, the amplitude of all the Fourier components will be small,
except those in the neighbourhood of the definite frequency. The
components whose amplitudes are not small will fill up a frequencyt
band whose width is of the order 1/Ag’, since two components whose
frequencies differ by this amount, if in phase in the middle of the
domain Aq’, will be just out of phase and interfering at the ends of
this domain. Now in the first of equations (55) the variable
(2:r)-1'/% = p'/h plays the part of frequency. Thus with <q’ |X of the
form of a wave packet, the function <p’|X>, being composed of the
amplitudes of the Fourier components of the wave packet, will be
small everywhere in the p’-space outside a certain domain of width
Ap’ = h/Aq'.

Let us now apply the physical interpretation of the square of the
modulus of the representative of a ket as a probability. We find that
our wave packet represents a state for which a measurement of ¢ is
almost certain to lead to a result lying in a domain of width Ag’ and
a measurement of p is almost certain to lead to a result lying in a
domain of width Ap’. We may say that for this state ¢ has a definite
value with an error of order Ag’ and p: has a definite value with an
error of order Ap’. The product of these two errors is

Aq'Ap’ = h. (56)

Thus the more accurately one of the variables g,p has a definite
value, the less accurately the other has a definite value. For a system
with several degrees of freedom, equation (56) applies to each degree
of freedom separately.

Equation (56) is known as Hetsenberg’s Principle of Uncertainty.
It shows clearly the limitations in the possibility of simultaneously
assigning numerical values, for any particular state, to two non-
commuting observables, when those observables are a canonical co-
ordinate and momentum, and provides a plain illustration of how
observations in quantum mechanics may be incompatible. It also
shows how classical mechanics, which assumes that numerical values
can be assigned simultaneously to all observables, may be a valid
approximation when h can be considered as small enough to be

{ Frequency here means reciprocal of wave-length.
﻿§ 24 HEISENBERG’S PRINCIPLE OF UNCERTAINTY 99

negligible. Hquation (56) holds only in the most favourable case,
which oceurs when the representative of the state is of the form of a
wave packet. Other forms of representative would lead to a Aq’ and
Ap’ whose product is larger than h.

Heisenberg’s principle of uncertainty shows that, in the limit when
either q or p is completely determined, the other is completely
undetermined. This result can also be obtained directly from the
transformation function <q'\p’>. According to the end of § 18,
l<q’|p’> |? dq’ is proportional to the probability of g having a value in
the small range from q’ to q’+-dq' for the state for which p certainly
has the value p’, and from (52) this probability is independent of q‘
for a given dq’. Thus if p certainly has a definite value p’, all values
of q are equally probable. Similarly, if g certainly has a definite value
q’, all values of » are equally probable.

It is evident physically that a state for which all values of g are
equally probable, or one for which all values of p are equally probable,
cannot be attained in practice, in the first case because of limitations
of size and in the second because of limitations of energy. Thus an
eigenstate of p or an eigenstate of g cannot be attained in practice.
The argument at the end of § 12 already showed that such eigenstates
are unattainable, because of the infinite precision that would be
needed to set them up, and we now have another argument leading
to the same conclusicn.

25. Displacement operators

We get a new insight into the meaning of some of the quantum con-
ditions by making a study of displacement operators. These appear
in the theory when we take into consideration that the scheme of
relations between states and dynamical variables given in Chapter II
is essentially a physical scheme, so that if certain states and dynamical
variables are connected by some relation, on our displacing them all
in a definite way (for example, displacing them all through a distance
6x in the direction of the z-axis of Cartesian coordinates), the new
states and dynamical variables would have to be connected by the
same relation.

The displacement of a state or observable is a perfectly definite
process physically. Thus to displace a state or observable through a
distance 6x in the direction of the z-axis, we should merely have to
displace all the apparatus used in preparing the state, or all the
﻿100 THE QUANTUM CONDITIONS § 25

apparatus required to measure the observable, through the distance
5z in the direction of the z-axis, and the displaced apparatus would
define the displaced state or observable. The displacement of a
dynamical variable must be just as definite as the displacement of
an observable, because of the close mathematical connexion between
dynamical variables and observables. A displaced state or dynamical
variable is uniquely determined by the undisplaced state or dynami-
eal variable together with the direction and magnitude of the dis-
placement.

The displacement of a ket vector is not such a definite thing though.
If we take a certain ket vector, it will represent a certain state and we
may displace this state and get a perfectly definite new state, but this
new state will not determine our displaced ket, but only the direction
of our displaced ket. We help to fix our displaced ket by requiring
that it shall have the same length as the undisplaced ket, but even
then it is not completely determined, but can still be multiplied by
an arbitrary phase factor. One would think at first sight that each
ket one displaces would have a different arbitrary phase factor,
but with the help of the following argument, we see that it must be
the same for them all. We make use of the law that superposition
relationships between states remain invariant under the displace-
ment. A superposition relationship between states is expressed
mathematically by a linear equation between the kets corresponding
to those states, for example ,

[RY = %|A)-+6,|B), (57)
where c, and c, are numbers, and the invariance of the superposition
relationship requires that the displaced states correspond to kets

with the same linear equation between them-—in our example they
would correspond to |Rd>, |Ad>, | Bd> say, satisfying

|Rd> = c,|Ad>-+e,| Bd). (58)

We take these kets to be our displaced kets, rather than these kets
multiplied by arbitrary independent phase factors, which latter
kets would satisfy a linear equation with different coefficients ¢,, ¢,.
The only arbitrariness now left in the displaced kets is that of a single
arbitrary phase factor to be multiplied into all of them.

The condition that linear equations between the kets remain in-
variant under the displacement and that an equation such as (58)
holds whenever the corresponding (57) holds, means that the dis-
﻿§ 25 DISPLACEMENT OPERATORS 101

placed kets are linear functions of the undisplaced kets and thus each
displaced ket | Pd) is the result of some linear operator applied to the
corresponding undisplaced ket |P>. In symbols,

|Pd> = D|P>, (59)

where D is a linear operator independent of |P> and depending only
on the displacement. The arbitrary phase factor by which all the
displaced kets may be multiplied results in D being undetermined
to the extent of an arbitrary numerical factor of modulus unity.
With the displacement of kets made definite in the above manner
and the displacement of bras, of course, made equally definite,
through their being the conjugate imaginaries of the kets, we can
now assert that any symbolic equation between kets, bras, and
dynamical variables must remain invariant under the displacement
of every symbol occurring in it, on account of such an equation
having some physical significance which will not get changed by the

displacement.
Take as an example the equation
<Q|P> = 6,
e being a number. Then we must have
<Qd|Pdy = ¢ = (Q|P>. (60)
From the conjugate imaginary of (59) with Q instead of P,
<Qd| = <Q|D. (61)
Hence (60) gives (Q|DD|P> = <Q|P)>.
Since this holds for arbitrary <Q| and |P>, we must have
DD = 1, (62)

giving us a general condition which D has to satisfy.
Take as a second example the equation

v[P> = |),
where v is any dynamical variable. Then, using vz to denote the
displaced dynamical variable, we must have

vg|Pd> = |Rd).
With the help of (59) we get
vq|Pd> = D|R> = Dv|P> = DvD-|Pdy.
Since |Pd> can be any ket, we must have
vg = DvD-, (63)

3895-57 H
﻿192 THE QUANTUM CONDITIONS § 25

which shows that the linear operator ) determines the displacement
of dynamical variables as well as that of kets and bras. Note that
the arbitrary numerical factor of modulus unity in D does not affect
vq, and also it does not affect the validity of (62).

Let us now pass to an infinitesimal displacement, ie. taking the
displacement through the distance 5x in the direction of the z-axis,
let us make 8x0. From physical continuity we should expect
a displaced ket |Pd> to tend to the original |P> and we may further
expect the limit

_ |Pd)—|P> ,.. D—1,
to exist. This requires that the limit
jim (D—1)/8x (64)
+O .

shall exist. This limit is a linear operator which we shall call the
displacement operator for the x-direction and denote by d,. The
arbitrary numerical factor e’” with y real which we may multiply
into D must be made to tend to unity as da — 0 and then introduces
an arbitrariness in d,, namely, d, may be replaced by

lim (De*”¥—1)/8a = jim (D—l+iy)/ie = d,+14,,

b2—>0 +0
where a, is the limit of y/8z. Thus d, contains an arbitrary additive
pure imaginary number. ~
For dx small D = 1+62zd,. (65)

Substituting this into (62), we get
(1+$2d,)(1+6ard,) = 1,
which reduces, with neglect of 5z*, to
da(d,+d,) = 0.

Thus d,, is a pure imaginary linear operator. Substituting (65) into
(63) we get, with neglect of 62? again,

vg = (1+8ed,)u(1—sad,) = v+S2(d,v—v d,), (66)
showing that jim (vg—v) [bu = d,v—vd,. (67)
+0

We may describe any dynamical system in terms of the following
dynamical variables: the Cartesian coordinates x, y,z of the centre of
mass of the system, the components p,, p,, p, of the total momentum
of the system, which are the canonical momenta conjugate to x,y,z
respectively, and any dynamical variables needed for describing
﻿§ 25 DISPLACEMENT OPERATORS 103

internal degrees of freedom of the system. If we suppose a piece
of apparatus which has been set up to measure z, to be displaced a
distance dx in the direction of the z-axis, it will measure e—6z, hence

Lq = E—S8e.
Comparing this with (66) for v = x, we obtain
d,c—ad, = —1. (68)

This is the quantum condition connecting d, with x. From similar
arguments we find that y,z,p,,p,, p, and the internal dynamical vari-
ables, which are unaffected by the displacement, must commute with
d,,. Comparing these results with (9), we see that iid, satisfies just
the same quantum conditions as p,. Their difference, p,—ihd,,
commutes with all the dynamical variables and must therefore be a
number. This number, which is necessarily real since p, and iid, are
both real, may be made zero by a suitable choice of the arbitrary,
pure imaginary number that can be added to d,. We then have the

result p, = thd, (69)

or the x-component of the total momentum of the system is ih tomes the

displacement operator d,,.
This is a fundamental result, which gives a new significance to

displacement operators. There is a corresponding result, of course,
also for the y and z displacement operators d, and d,, The quantum
conditions which state that p,, p, and p, commute with each other
are now seen to be connected with the fact that displacements in

different directions are commutable operations.

26. Unitary transformations
Let U be any linear operator that has a reciprocal U~! and con-

sider the equation ot = Ua-1, (70)

« being an arbitrary linear operator. This equation may be regarded
as expressing a transformation from any linear operator « to a
corresponding linear operator «*, and as such it has rather remarkable
properties. In the first place it should be noted that each a* has the
same eigenvalues as the corresponding q; since, if a’ is any eigenvalue
of « and |«’> is an eigenket belonging to it, we have
ala”> = a’ la"
and hence
a*U la’) = UxUU la’) = Uala’> = a'U |’),
﻿104 THE QUANTUM CONDITIONS § 26

showing that U|a’> is an eigenket of «* belonging to the same eigen-
value a’, and similarly any eigenvalue of «* may be shown to be also
an eigenvalue of «. Further, if we take several «’s that are connected
by algebraic equations and transform them all according to (70), the
corresponding a*’s will be connected by the same algebraic equations.
This result follows from the fact that the fundamental algebraic pro-
cesses of addition and multiplication are left invariant by the trans-
formation (70), as is shown. by the following equations:

(af og)* = Uloy+a,)U-? = Ua,0-1+ Vay 0-1 = of 40%,

(ay ofg)* = Joy ag U-? = Ua U-U ag U-1 = ao,

Let us now see what condition would be imposed on U by the
requirement that any real « transforms into a real «*. Equation

(70) may be written wt = Una. (71)

Taking the conjugate complex of both sides in accordance with
(5) of § 8 we find, if « and «* are both real,

Oa* = aU. (72)
Equation (71) givesus  UatU = TUa
and equation (72) gives us
Oa*U = aU.
Hence Ux = aU.

Thus UU commutes with any real linear operator and therefore also
with any lmear operator whatever, since any linear operator can be
expressed as one real one plus z times another. Hence UU is:a
number. It is obviously real, its conjugate complex according to (5)
of §8 being the same as itself, and further it must be a positive
number, since for any ket |P>, <P|UU|P) is positive as well as
<P|\P>. We can suppose it to be unity without any loss of generality
in the transformation (70). We then have

UU =1. (73)
Equation (73) is equivalent to any of the following
U = 0-3, U = U-3, U-10-1 = 1, (74)

A matrix or linear operator U that satisfies (73) and (74) is said
to be unitary and a transformation (70) with unitary U is called a
unitary transformation. A unitary transformation transforms real
linear operators into real linear operators and leaves invariant any
﻿§ 26 UNITARY TRANSFORMATIONS 105

algebraic equation between linear operators. It may be considered
as applying also to kets and bras, in accordance with the equations

[P*) = U|P>, << P*| = <P|U = (P|U4, (75)
and then it leaves invariant any algebraic equation between linear
operators, kets, and bras. It transforms eigenvectors of « into eigen-
vectors of «*. From this one can easily deduce that it transforms an
observable into an observable and that it leaves invariant any func-
tional relation between observables based on the general definition
of a function given in § 11.

The inverse of a unitary transformation is also a unitary trans-
formation, since from (74), if U is unitary, U-1 is also unitary.
Further, if two unitary transformations are applied in succession,
the result is a third unitary transformation, as may be verified in
the following way. Let the two unitary transformations be (70) and ©

ot = Va*V-1,
The connexion between a! and a is then
at = VUoU-4V-4
= (VU )a(VU)4 (76)
from (42) of §11. Now VU is unitary since
VUVU = UVVU = UU = 1,
and hence (76) is a unitary transformation.

The transformation given in the preceding section from undisplaced
to displaced quantities is an example of a unitary transformation, as
is shown by equations (62), (63), corresponding to equations (73),
(70), and equations (59), (61), corresponding to equations (75). -

In classical mechanics one can make a transformation from the
canonical coordinates and momenta q,, p, (r = 1,..,”) to a new set of
variables g*, p* (r = 1,..,”) satisfying the same P.B. relations as the
q’s and p’s, i.e. equations (8) of § 21 with g*’s and p*’s replacing the
g’sand p’s, and can express all dynamical variables in terms of the g*’s
and p*’s. The g*’s and p*’s are then also called canonical coordinates
and momenta and the transformation is called a contact transforma-
tion. One can easily verify that the P.B. of any two dynamical
variables u and v is correctly given by formula (1) of § 21 with g*’s and
p*’s instead of q’s and p’s, so that the P.B. relationship is invariant
under a contact transformation. This results in the new canonical
coordinates and momenta being on the same footing as the original
ones for many purposes of general dynamical theory, even though the
﻿106 THE QUANTUM CONDITIONS § 26

new coordinates g* may not be a set of Lagrangian coordinates but
may be functions of the Lagrangian coordinates and velocities.

It will now be shown that, for a quantum dynamical system that
has a classical analogue, unitary transformations in the quantum theory
are the analogue of contact transformations in the classical theory.
Unitary transformations are more general than contact transforma-
tions, since the former can be applied to systems in quantum
mechanics that have no classical analogue, but for those systems in
quantum mechanics which are describable in terms of canonical
coordinates and momenta, the analogy between the two kinds of
transformation holds. To establish it, we note that a unitary trans-
formation applied to the quantum variables g,, p, gives new variables .
g*, p* satisfying the same P.B. relations, since the P.B. relations are
equivalent to the algebraic relations (9) of § 21 and algebraic relations
are left invariant by a unitary transformation. Conversely, any real
variables 9*, p* satisfying the P.B. relations for canonical coordinates
and momenta are connected with the q,,p, by a unitary transforma-
tion, as is shown by the following argument.
| We use the Schrédinger representation, and write the basic ket
l0---Gn> a8 |g’> for brevity. Since we are assuming that the g*, p*
satisfy the P.B. relations for canonical coordinates and momenta,
we can set up a Schrodinger representation referring to them, with
the g* diagonal and each p* equal to —ik /ég*. The basic kets in
this second Schrédinger representation will be |g#’...¢%>, which we
write |q*'> for brevity. Now introduce the linear operator U defined by

<q*'|U|q’> = 8(g*’—4’), (77)

where 5(¢*’—g’) is short for
8(q*—9') = 8a’ —91)8(GF — 9)... 8(Gh' — Ga) (78)

The conjugate complex of (77) is
<q |Tlg*’> = 8" —q'),

and hencet
| <7 TU 9"> = | <@'ITlg*"> dg® <g*"|Ulg">
| = ii 8(g*’—q') dq*’ 8(g*’—4"')
= 8(q'—9"),
so that UU = 1.

+ We use the notation of a single integral sign and dg*’ to denote an integral over
all the variables gi’, qi’,..., g%’.. This abbreviation will be used also in future work.
﻿§ 26 UNITARY TRANSFORMATIONS 107

Thus U is a unitary operator. We have further
<a gr U |g’) = aF'5(q*'—9')
and <q Ug, ig'> = 8(q*—9')4,-

The right-hand sides of these two equations are equal on account of -
the property of the 5 function (11) of § 15, and hence

qr U = Ug,
or g* = Ug, U-1.
Again, from (45) and (46),

, ‘ Mg a , ,
<Q pr U lg"> = — th 8g" —9'),
Tr
é i , a , i
UP I> = he Bg" 4).
The right-hand sides of these two equations are obviously equal, and
hence ptU = Up,
or p* = Up, U-.

Thus all the conditions for a unitary transformation are verified.
We get an infinitesimal unitary transformation by taking U in (70)
to differ by an infinitesimal from unity. Put

U = 1+ieF,
where ¢ is infinitesimal, so that its square can be neglected. Then
O-+ = 1—ieF,

The unitary condition (73) or (74) requires that F' shall be real. The
transformation equation (70) now takes the form

a® = (ltteF )a(1—teF),

which gives a*—a = te(Fa—at). (79)
It may be written in P.B. notation
a*—a = efifa, F’]. (80)

If « is a canonical coordinate or momentum, this is formally the same
as a Classical infinitesimal contact transformation.
